## Judicial Politics Literature

**Legitimacy**

-   Verbal attacks can undermine the court's legitimacy

**Transparency can increase resilience**

-   Press Realeases and Oral Hearings can increase coverage of constiutional court decisions (Staton 2010, Krehbiel 2016, Gauri et al. 2015)

-   If people know about a decision, they can enforce compliance at the ballot box (Vanberg 2001)

# Empirics

## Case Selection

-   **Austria** is a prominent example of populist government participation
-   **FPÖ** & **BZÖ** prototypical examples of right-wing populism (Mudde 2013, Pelinka 2013)

## Case Selection

-   **Independent** Constitutional Court (Lachmayer 2017)

-   High **trust** in the Austrian Constitutional Court (OMG 2022)

## Data

**Judicial Review in Austria 2006 - 2021**

-   Unit of Analysis: Law under Review
-   \> 1000 cases
-   Dummy for Press Release (unfinished) & Public Hearing
-   Dummy for populist legislator

## Data

**Dependent Variable**

-   Press Release Dummy
-   Public Hearing Dummy

**Independent Variable**

-   Populist Legislator
-   [Interaction Populist Legislator x Decision]{.rose}

## Estimation

**Fixed-Effects Model**

-   Fixed-Effects for Court President

**Mixed-Effects Model**

-   Random Intercepts for Court President
-   Random Intercepts for Decision
    -   Multiple Laws can be reviewed in one decision

## Conclusion

- So far, no evidence for increased PR-activity when facing populists
- Might be due to small number of cases 
- Implications that court only worries if there is no coalition partner to moderate populists
