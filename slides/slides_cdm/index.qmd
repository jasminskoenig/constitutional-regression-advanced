-   More Constitutional Changes under populist government
-   Effects differ with what aspect of democracy is considered

# THEORY {.theme-section1}


## POPULISM

<br>

::: quote
"\[Populism is an\] ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, 'the pure people' versus 'the corrupt elite', and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people."

## POPULISM & CONSTITUIONAL CHANGE

General Will

-   Constitutions are political (Blokker 2020, Mazzoleni & Voerman 2020)
-   Mirror the will of the people (Tushnet 2015, Fabbrizi 2020)
- Popular Sovereignty as key of democracy (Rovira Kaltwasser 2012, Mazzoleni & Voerman 2020)
- Radical Democracy (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013)

Homogenous People

-   No need for stable checks & balances

::: fragment
::: quote
"Constituent power, rather than being the power of the multitude, becomes the power of the majority."

Homogenous People

-   No need for stable checks & balances

::: fragment
<br>

::: task
**Hypothesis 1**: Governments including populist actors are more likely to amend or renew constitutions than non-populist governments.
:::
:::

## DEMOCRATIC DIMENSIONS

::: fragment
Liberal Democracy

-   Institutions
-   Minority Rights
-   Hotizontal Accountability
:::

::: fragment
Participation

-   Direct Democratic Measures
-   Power of Local Politicians
:::

::: fragment
Egalitarianism

-   Equal access to power
-   Equal resources for participation
-   Rights and freedoms equal for all social groups
:::

## POPULISM & DEMOCRATIC QUALITY {.smaller}

::: fragment
**Liberal Democracy**

-   Majoritarianism (Blokker 2019, Urbinati 2019)
-   Executive Aggrandizement (De La Torre & De Lara 2020, Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013 )
:::

## CONTENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

**Liberal Democracy**

::: task
**Hypotheses 2**: The quality of liberal democracy is decreased through governments including populist actors, independent of their host-ideology.
:::

::: fragment
**Participation**

-   Advocate direct democracy (Bowler et al 2017)
-   More channels for participation
:::

**Liberal Democracy**

**Hypotheses 2**: The quality of liberal democracy is decreased through governments including populist actors, independent of their host-ideology.
:::

**Participation**

::: task
**Hypotheses 3**: The quality of participation is increased through constitutional changes under governments independent of their ideology.
:::

::: fragment
**Egalitarism**

-   Depends on the definition of *the people*
-   Culturally right-wing parties are likely to exclude groups from rights & participation
-   Economically left-wing parties are likely to redistribute
    -   Increase in resources for participation
-   Culturally left-wing parties are likely to include ethnic minorities

## HOWEVER

Not all results replicate with the binary coding of populists in government

<br>

Not significant but **same direction**

-   Likelihood of Constitutional Change
-   Effect on Egalitarian Democracy
-   Effect on Participation

::: fragment
Not significant but **different direction**

-   Effect on Liberal Democracy

## CONCLUSION

Populism does not use constitutional changes to decrease democratic quality

- We need to go beyond the salient cases
