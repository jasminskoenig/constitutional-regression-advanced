# THEORY {.theme-section1}

# DO POPULISTS USE <br> CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES <br>  MORE FREQUENTLY?

## POPULISM 

<br>

::: quote
"\[Populism is an\] ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two **homogeneous** and antagonistic groups, 'the pure people' versus 'the corrupt elite', and which argues that politics should be an **expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people.**"

<br>

Mudde (2004)
:::

## POPULISM & CONSTITUIONAL CHANGE

General Will

-   Constitutions are political (Blokker 2020, Mazzoleni & Voerman 2020)
-   Mirror the will of the people (Tushnet 2015, Fabbrizi 2020)
- Popular Sovereignty as key of democracy (Rovira Kaltwasser 2012, Mazzoleni & Voerman 2020)
- Radical Democracy (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013)

::: fragment
Homogenous People

-   No need for stable checks & balances

## POPULISM & CONSTITUIONAL CHANGE {visibility="uncounted"}


::: task
**Hypothesis 1**: Governments including populist actors are more likely to amend or renew constitutions than non-populist governments.

# THE EFFECTS OF <br> CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES <br> UNDER POPULIST GOVERNMENTS {.smaller}

## HETEROGENOUS POPULISM

- Exclusionary vs inclusionary populism (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013)
  - Exclusion of people who are not considered part of the people
  - Inclusion of more people in society in politics
  
- Strong impact of host-ideology on populist demands
- Different emphasis on participation

## LIBERAL DEMOCRACY

- Understanding of a **homogenous** people
- The **general will** as the only legitimate input in the decision-making process
  -   Majoritarianism (Blokker 2019, Urbinati 2019)
  -   Executive Aggrandizement (De La Torre & De Lara 2020, Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013)
      - Disregard for checks and balances


:::fragment
::: task
**Hypotheses 2**: The quality of liberal democracy is decreased through governments including populist actors, independent of their host-ideology.
:::
:::

## PARTICIPATION


- Returning power **back to the people**
  -   Advocate direct democracy (Bowler et al 2017)
  -   More channels for participation
  -  Mudde and Kaltwasser (2013) connect participation to left-wing populists
  - But, other authors argue that right-wing populists also campaign for reforms towards more participation (Bedock et al 2022)


:::fragment
::: task
**Hypotheses 3**: The quality of participation is increased through constitutional changes under governments, independent of their ideology.
:::
:::

## EGALITARIANISM


-   Depends on the definition of *the people*
-   Culturally right-wing parties are likely to exclude groups from rights & participation
-   Economically left-wing parties are likely to redistribute
    -   Increase in resources for participation
-   Culturally left-wing parties are likely to include ethnic minorities

(Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2013, Blokker 2019, Bugaric 2019)

::: fragment
::: task
**Hypotheses 4**: The quality of egalitarianism is increased through constitutional changes under governments including a left-wing populist actor, and decreased under governments including a right-wing populist actor.

## CONCLUSION

Populism does not always use constitutional changes to decrease democratic quality

- We need to look at specific democratic characteristics
- We need to go beyond the salient cases
- The often emphasized heterogeneous nature of populism also applies to their constitutional changes
- We need to look at policies as well as rhetoric
