A question that remains unanswered is whether the judiciary can be protected from such attacks on their independence. I argue that trust in the institution can safeguard the independent judiciary from such attacks as it

# Introduction

Again and again, we hear warnings that populists - once in power - first dismantle the independent judiciary [@Scheppele.2019; @Vosskuhle.2023; @Muller.2017]. One way to do so is by replacing or adding judges. We know that public support is a necessary condition for an effective judiciary otherwise there are too few reasons to comply with judicial decisions [@Gibson.1998; @Vanberg.2001; @Vanberg.2015; @Krehbiel.2020; @Buhlmann.2011]. But, can support among the public also prevent courts from being a target of executive aggrandizement? Using V-Dem, Euro- and Latinobarometer data, we examine whether high trust in the judiciary among the public safeguards the judiciary from attacks on its independence.

Populists are gaining power in more and more countries around the world [@Vittori.2022]. Their core belief is that the will of the people is and should be the ultimate guide for political decisions. Any other actor is often described as part of a corrupt elite that obstructs the people's right to power [@Mudde.2004]. This leads them to challenge and often dismiss the of non-majoritarian entities like judiciary branches [@Abts.2007; @Mudde.2012b; @Mazzoleni.2020]. While there's increasing interest in understanding the repercussions of populists in power for democracy [@Huber.2017; @Kenny.2020; @RuthLovell.2022], we’ve yet to understand whether institutions can effectively counter populists once they hold office.

We turn to the literature on judicial politics for answers. For decades scholar have emphasized the importance of citizens in enforcing democratic behavior by governments [@Weingast.1997; @Vanberg.2001; @Krehbiel.2020]. According to this idea, politicians fear being punished at the next election and thus refrain from undermining judicial independence. But, if people do not trust their high court, they have few incentives to defend such an institution at the ballot box. Lately, studies have further shown that voters are willing to trade-off democratic norms, such as judicial independence, for economic or partisan gains [@GRAHAM.2020; @Bartels.2020c; @Gidengil.2022b].

In our analysis, we test whether populists in office replace or add judges more frequently than other governments based on V-Dem data [@vdem.2021]. Using data from Euro- and Latinobarometer, we estimate whether court purges and packing takes place more frequently if fewer citizens trust the judiciary [@EuropeanCommission.2020; @Latinobarometro.2023]. Lastly, we combine these approaches and test whether populists in office have less of a negative effect on court composition if trust in the judiciary is high.

Our country fixed-effects model shows that populists in power are more likely to add or remove judges for political reasons. However, we do not find any evidence that an increase in trust in the judiciary within a country decreases the likelihood of court purges or packing, neither under populist nor non-populist governments.

# The Rise of Populism and Why it Threatens the Independent Judiciary

The judiciary, in particular constitutional courts, are often regarded as the guardians of democracy \[@Ferejohn.2009; @Prendergast.2019; @Vanberg.2005, ch. 1 & 3 \]. By independently interpreting and applying the law, the judiciary acts as a check on the executive and legislative branches. The judiciary is tasked with safeguarding citizens from governmental abuses of power, as well as shielding minorities from potential tyranny by the majority \[@Rogers.2020; @Stephenson.2004; @StoneSweet.2002; @Whittington.2010\].

However, in times of democratic regression, the independent judiciary increasingly finds itself under threat in Europe and Latin America. Governments exhibiting authoritarian tendencies are actively seeking to undermine judicial independence as part of their efforts to expand and solidify their power [@XXX]. Given the judiciary's pivotal role as a check on executive power, the weakening of judicial power is often one of the first step sin the process of democratic backsliding [@XXX]. A judiciary that is either captured or weakened has less power, or inclination, to stop subsequent attempts to erode democracy. Consequently, it becomes easier for the executive to assault the political opposition, dismantle democratic institutions, or breach of democratic norms.

XXX Bessere Überleitung "The anti-majoritarian nature of the judiciary, bla bla, neutral law, bla bla"

The increasing number of attacks against the judiciary is frequently attributed to the rise of populism [@Arato.2019; @Scheppele.2019; @Muller.2016; @Schafer.2021]. The populist ideology builds on the belief in a homogeneous people that is morally good and capable to govern itself. In contrast, elites are depicted as the enemy of the morally good people [@Mudde.2004]. The populist vision of a democracy governed by majority rule directly challenges the system of checks and balances integral to liberal democracies [@Canovan.1999; @Meny.2002b; @Abts.2007]. Liberal democracy is based on the separation of powers, a cornerstone of which is an independent judiciary [@Abts.2007].

Indeed, populists frequently undermine judicial power once they are in government. In Hungary, Orbán has implemented a new constitution and replaced many judges with co-partisans [@Bencze.2022]. In Poland, independent judges were forced to retire to change the court compostition under the populist PiS' goverment [@Sadurski.2019]. The populist Kirchner government in Argentina tried to push a senior judge out of the court, who was forced to go through psycho-physical tests to not be removed from the Supreme court [@Scribner.2017]. But, not in every case of populist government can we observe such a pattern. While SYRIZA's government in 2015-2019, judicial independence did not significantly decrease. Indeed, there constitutional reform proposal even included the implementation of a Supreme Court to strengthen the rule of law [@Lorencka.2019].

So far, most cross-country studies have investigated the effect of populists in power on democratic quality more generally, with judicial independence as a part of an index [@Huber.2017; @RuthLovell.2022; @Juon.2020; @Konig.2024]. Their results paint a similar picture: Populists in power decrease the quality of liberal democracy, only @Konig.2024 found a positive effect in Latin American countries. But, so far we lack studies on the distinct effects on the judiciary.

Goverments have a whole range of options to target the independent judiciary. They can target either the court's composition, or its jurisdiction. We focus on the former case: By replacing (purging) or adding friendly judges (packing) governments can capture a court [@Arato.2019; @Huq.2018]. Since courts are dependent on their perceived legitimacy among the public, politicians can also undermine the judiciary through on-going attacks [@AydinCakir.2023].[^1] We expect that these strategies are used more frequently under populist governments due to their strained relationship to non-majoritarian institutions.

[^1]: We know that framing of judicial actors as partisan players reduces confidence in the judiciary [@Ramirez.2008; @Baird.2006; @Magalhaes.2023; @Bonneau.2017].

\textbf{Hypothesis 1}: Populist in power increase the likelihood that court packing, purges or attacks on the judiciary take place.
\end{quote}
```
With the growing number of countries that experience a decrease in the quality of liberal democratic institutions [@Waldner.2018; @Luhrmann.2019; @Laebens.2021],

If the guardians of democracy are now in the cross-fire of populist governments, the question arises who can shield the guardian against attacks. Scholars are increasingly interested in what makes democracies resilient against the erosion of its institutions [@Merkel.2021; @Boese.2021; @Laebens.2021; @LaTorre.2018]. Most studies agree that an organized and active resistance against autocratization among citizens is crucial to avert the erosion of democratic institutions, such as the judiciary [@Druckman.2023; @Laebens.2021; @Luhrmann.2021]. Citizens have the power to hold the executive accountable for their actions [@Druckman.2023]. 

Citizens are often regarded as the shield of the independent judiciary [@Vanberg.2015]. While being a crucial democratic institution, the judiciary is also inherently weak \[@Staton.2010, @Vanberg.2015; @Krehbiel.2020\]. Particularly high courts have neither the power of the "purse" nor the "sword". Neither can they can enforce their constraints on the executive \[@Vanberg.2001; @Staton.2006; @Krehbiel.2020\]. They can not defend themselves against attacks as well as other institutions since courts aim to be perceived as neutral. But, they have to take decisions against the preferences of the majority and the executive \[@Gibson.1998\]. To unfold its power, the judiciary needs support among the public [@Buhlmann.2011; @Vanberg.2001; @Staton.2006].

One common explanation as to why governments respect judicial independence, despite the possibility to simply ignore the judiciary, is the fear of a public backlash \[@Vanberg.2001; @Vanberg.2005; @Krehbiel.2020\]. This idea has been developed primarily in the realm of judicial review. Especially in cases of judicial review, courts do not have the power to enforce their decisions themselves [@Vanberg.2015; @Staton.2010]. The notion is that if citizens support and trust the judiciary, they will defend the institution in upcoming elections by voting for a different party [@Vanberg.2001; @Vanberg.2005; @Gibson.1998; @Staton.2006; @Staton.2010; @Krehbiel.2020].

This mechanism should work similarly if courts are under political threats. Evasion of judicial review is just one mechanism that the executive can use to undermine judicial power. Citizens who value and trust the judiciary should also be concerned about political changes to the court composition or attacks on the judiciary by the executive. The current debate of judical reforms in Isreal illustrates this logic: For months, citizens went to the streets against the executive's decisions to restrict judicial review [@Bazelon.2023]. Recently, the high court decided that at least some of the reform's policies were unconstitutional [@reuters.2024]. While we do not know yet whether the executive will accept the decision on the long-term, the public protests might have paved the way for the high court's decision. The protesters signaled that non-compliance with the high court would backlash in any upcoming election.

Lately, the notion that public support shields the judiciary has been under empirical scrutiny. Some of the empirical evidence implies that voters are not willing to punish attacks on judicial independence if the partisan or policy costs are too high [@Driscoll.2023b; @Jacob.2024; @Wunsch.2023; @Bartels.2020; @GRAHAM.2020; @SVOLIK.2020]. Instead support for (horizontal) judicial power depends on whether their preferred party is in power [@Bartels.2020c]. If the incumbent is a co-partisan, support for judicial power decreases. In a similar vein, support for the judiciary is dependent on whether judicial decisions are taken in one's own interests [@Bartels.2023]. But, the evidence is not unilateral, other studies find that candidates who attack the independent judiciary receive a lower vote share [@Engst.2023]. @Saikkonen.2023 find that this is the case, even if the candidate represents the respondent's preferred policy positions on a contentious topic. @Krehbiel.2020 further shows that voters did punish non-compliance with judicial review in a cross-country study of 74 states. But, we lack cross-national comparison beyond western democracies on whether support for the judiciary among the public constrains attacks on the institution.

If government parties are indeed worried about a potential electoral backlash, we should observe fewer attacks on the judiciary the more people trust the independent judiciary. In this case, they would have to consider each citizen who trusts the court as a potential person who might punish the governments. Thus we expect that court packing or purges occur less frequently if trust in the judiciary is high.

<!--#Combining the two strands of research, the question arises whether public trust in the judiciary can act as a shield against populist attempts to undermine judicial independence. So far, we know little how populist voters view the judiciary. While some studies show that populists citizens hold similar democratic attitudes as non-populist citizens [@Wuttke.2022; @Zaslove.2023]. According to @Wuttke.2022, populist citizens support the rule of law similarly as other citizens. However, such studies do not account for the incumbent effect. Once populists are in office, the support for non-majoritarian institutions might decrease among populist citizens [@Muller.2016; @vanderBrug.2021]. We test whether the likelihood that populists attack the judiciary is conditioned by trust in the institution.   -->

<!-- #Citizens particularly important in young democracies where institutions are still volatile [@]. These are likely also the countries where trust is low. -->

<!-- @Bermeo.2016 (p. 10-11) summarizes the core of democratic backsliding as executive aggrandizement, in the course of which horizontal accountability is weakened and power is accumulated in the executive. This often includes the dismantling of judicial independence. -->

<!-- Strong horizontal accountability can increase democratic resilience as well [@Boese.2021, XXX]. Particularly the judiciary is often regarded as the "guardian" or "bulwark" of democracy [@Ferejohn.2009; @Satrio.2018; @Boese.2021]. Courts, particularly those that can exercise judicial review, hold the power to restrain the executive [@Ginsburg.2018b]. But, institutions that can hold the executive accountable, such as an independent judiciary, are frequently restricted in the process of democratic backsliding themselves. The power of an independent judiciary places it in the crossfire of autocratization tendencies. -->

<!-- Under this crossfire, the judiciary can only prevail if it is supported by the public  -->

# Research Design

To study the effect of populists in government on judicial independence, we run an OLS model with country fixed-effects.

**Variables**

The first dependent variable indicates whether a country has experienced politically motivated changes in court compositions. The V-Dem dataset collects this information in two variables on judicial purges (`v2jupurg_ord`) and court packing (`v2jupack_ord`) which indicate whether there was a "massive" or "limited, politically motivated increase in the number of judgeships" [@vdemcodebook.2022, p. 163], or "removal of judges" [@vdemcodebook.2022, p. 164].[^2] We combine these into one variable, by choosing the score that indicates more political interventions. The new variable ranges from -1.98 to 4.27 (see appendix \@fig-histdepv). Additionally, we run regressions with V-Dem's variable on the frequency of attacks on the judiciary (`v2jupoatck`). The variable ranges from -2.86 to 4.4 (see appendix \@fig-histdepv).

[^2]: See the appendix for robustness tests with different operationalizations of the variable.

The data on populism is taken from @RuthLovell.2022 who in turn have used the PopuList [@Rooduijn.2019] and data from @Huber.2017 additionally to their own coding. The variable is binary with 1 indicating that the head of government is populist, otherwise the variable is 0. We have updated the dataset for the years since 2018.

![Density plot of dependent variables.](results/graphs/independentvar_histogram.pdf){#fig-histdepv fig-align="center"}

Data on trust in the judiciary is aggregated from the Latinobarometer [@Latinobarometro.2023] and the Eurobarometer [@EuropeanCommission.2020]. From the survey data, we calculated a variable that indicates what percentage of respondents in the respective year trusted the judiciary in their country. While the Eurobarometer only includes two possible answers, *trust* or *do not trust*, the Latinobarometer includes four categories "A lot", "Some", "Little" and "No trust" [@Latinobarometro.2023]. To calculcate the share of people who trust the judiciary, we have recoded the variable into a dummy that codes people who trust the judiciary *a lot* or *some* as trusting the judiciary. We run a robustness check in which respondents who trust the judiciary *a lot*, *some* or *little* are included in the share of people who trust the court. Since the regression models include country fixed-effects, differences in the coding between the continents should not lead to wrong estimates as only the within country variance of the variable is used.

Both, Latino- and Eurobarometer, include some years with missing observations. In these cases we have imputed data. Our imputation mechanism assumes that trust has developed linearly throughout the missing observations. In the main model, we use the last three years' mean for this variable. We include models in the appendix (see @tbl-indepv and @tbl-indepv_w) with other operationalizations (one year lag, mean of last 5 years) as well as different handling of the missing data on trust: In one, we drop the observations with missing values. In the other we use an imputation mechanisms that chooses the value from the closest date.

![Density plot of independent variable trust in judiciary. Color indicates years under populist and non-populist governments.](results/graphs/trust_histogram.pdf){fig-align="center"}

**Controls**

The models include controls for the power of the executive with an index built with the Comparative Constitutions dataset [@ComparativeConstitutions.2005; @Elkins.2012]. Further controls for the share of surplus seats of a government and whether it was a coalition based on the V-Party dataset [@VParty.2020]. We include a dummy, whether the country has a presidential system, and continuous variables on the regime age, and the average GDP growth from the last three years [@wdi.2020].

In one of our robustness tests that estimate the effect on court purges and packing, we include a variable that indicates whether court purges or packing has already occured in the respective country in the last five years. We code this based on the ordinal variables of V-Party's `v2jupack_ord` and `v2jupoatck_ord`, and count any expert coding of political replacements (independent of scope and importance of court) as court purges and packing [@vdemdata.2022; see @sec-coding for more information]. The idea behind this model is that once the dam has been broken and court compositions have been changed, there is little reason to not do it again. With an interaction effect between populism, trust and court packing/purges in the last three/five years, we test whether trust only constrains executives from starting to replace judges but not on on-going phases of replacements.

Trust in the judiciary might have a particularly strong effect on executives' decisions to undermine the judiciary if judicial independence is high. In these cases citizens are more likely to perceive executive decisions as a deviation of the norm how the judiciary is usually treated. @Krehbiel.2020 shows that particularly in environments with a strong norm for high court compliance, citizens punish the government if they do not comply with high court decisions. We include a model in which we interact trust and judicial independence to estimate whether the effect of trust is condititonal on the judiciary's independence. To measure the latter we use the mean of the last three years' variable on judicial independence from V-Dem [@vdemdata.2022].

# Results

Our findings corroborate the initial hypothesis that instances of court packing and judicial purges are more prevalent under populist governments. The same is the case with regard to attacks on the judiciary. Consistently across various models, the coefficient associated with populism is positive and significant, reinforcing the prevailing notion that populists in government undermine judicial independence.

This outcome is robust in nearly all the models we examined. Even when we exclude the country-year observations in which Euro- and Latinobarometer have missing values, the effect of populism on court purges and packing as well as attacks on the judiciary are significantly positive. Within these intervals, populist governments have implemented notable transformations of the judiciary. In Hungary, for example, politically aligned judges were nominated in 2011 (such as Tünde Handó, the wife of the FIDESZ founder, as president of the National Judiciary Office). But, Eurobarometer did not collect information on trust in the judiciary that year. We include an overview of all country-year observations in which trust data is missing but judicial purges or packing took place in the appendix (@fig-imputed).

However, the results raise some doubts whether the public's attitudes toward the court act as the shield, in the way we have always understood them to (see @Vanberg-2015). The analysis indicates that an increase in citizens who trust the judiciary does not reduce the likelihood of court packing and purges, nor of attacks on the judiciary. In the case of court purges and packing, our main model even shows a significant positive effect of higher trust (see @tbl-results, model 1). But, the significance of the coefficient is not robust across different operationalizations of the variable (see @tbl-indepv_w_pp). Still, in all of the models we calculated, the effect of trust among the public in the judiciary has either the opposite effect as expect, or no effect at all. In none of our models do we find evidence that an increase of trust within a country decreases the likelihood of court purges or packing.

With regard to attacks on the judiciary, higher trust among the public does not seem to have an effect at all (@tbl-results, model 3). This result is robust across all our models (see appendix @fig-coefpp and @fig-coefatck).

We only find the expected conditioning effect of trust on governments undermining judicial independence when we compare across countries (see appendix @tbl-fullpp, model 4 and @tbl-fullatck, model 4). As soon as we include a country fixed-effect, the effect reverses (see appendix @tbl-fullpp, model 2 and @tbl-fullatck, model 2). Thus, the positive effect of higher trust in the judiciary in the between country analysis might be driven by other factors that vary between countries.

This result holds once we include an interaction effect between populism and trust. We find that trust does not significantly condition whether populists replace or add judges to courts (see @tbl-results, model 2 and @fig-ame). In all models, the coefficient ranges around 0 and is not significant (see @fig-coefppint).

In the case of attacks on the judiciary, the results point in the opposite direction as expected: The higher the trust in the judiciary, the more populists attack the institution (see @tbl-results, model 2 and @fig-ame). If we also include people who only trust the judiciary *little*, the interaction effect is significant and negative.

![Average marginal effect of populist in power conditioned by share of respondents who trust the judiciary.](results/graphs/ols_interaction.pdf){#fig-ame fig-align="center"}

**Initial Court Purges and Packing**

A previous decision by the executive to change court compositions for political reasons might impact their decision to take these steps again. Once the dam is broken, there is little reason to not take similar steps again. We test this by including an interaction effect with the dummy variable that indicates whether court purges or packing has taken place in the last three or five years. We ran one model including a simple interaction effect between trust and former court purges or packing to test whether this is a general relationship. The effect is not significant, even if there have not been any changes in court compositions in the years before trust does not have an effect on the likelihood of court purges or packing (see appendix, @tbl-dynamic_pp, model 2 and 4).

In another model, we include a triple interaction effect between populism, trust and former court purges and packing. The results shows that trust does not condition populist executive's decisions to change court compositions, independent of whether such actions were already taken in the years before (see appendix, @tbl-dynamic_pp, model 3 and 5).

**Judicial Independence**

In @tbl-dynamic_ji_atck and @tbl-dynamic_ji_pp, we test whether the effect of trust on executives' decisions to undermine the judiciary is conditioned by the former quality of judicial independence. But, contrary to our expectation, the model implies that in cases of high judicial independence, high trust increases the likelihood of court purges and packing (see @tbl-dynamic_ji_pp, model 2 and @fig-dynpp). Considering attacks on the judiciary, we do not find that judicial independence conditions the effect of trust (see @tbl-dynamic_ji_atck, model 2 and @fig-dynatck).

### Discussion

If we look at the data behind our models, we see that significant attacks on judicial independence such as in Poland in 2019 have taken place when trust in the judiciary was relatively high. In Poland, only 22% of the people trusted the judiciary in 2007, but the attacks on the judiciary took place between 2015 and 2019 when more than 40% of the people responded that they trusted the courts. One explanation as to why we find a conditioning effect of trust in the judiciary on attacks on the latter is that trust just has not risen high enough in countries that have experiences such attacks. Take Poland as an example, despite a significant increase in trust in the judiciary over time (almost 20%), a majority of the citizens still did not trust the judiciary when the PiS government decided to undermine judicial independence.

In general, our results can not speak to the mechanism behind our finding that within country increases of trust in the judiciary do not decrease the likelihood of attacks on the judiciary. Recently, many scholars have shown that voters lack the willingness to translate their diffuse support for the court into actions at the ballot box [@Jacob.2024; @Wunsch.2023; @Driscoll.2023b]. However, there might also be other reasons for our finding. Short-term increases in trust might not have the same effect as long-term trust in the judiciary. A court that has been a trusted institution for multiple decades might be defended more willingly than a comparatively young institution, or one that has only gained the trust of the public. Another reason for this finding might be that the public does not recognize attacks on the judiciary as such [@Chiopris.2024]. @Magalhaes.2023 show that trust in the judiciary in Hungary did not decrease once the judiciary's independence was undermined by president Orbán. These results imply that citizens might not have recognized the actions as problematic.

So far, experimental studies are restricted to few countries. Our cross-country comparison corrobates the findings of earlier research that we might have overestimated the effect of voters' support as a shield for the judiciary. The results show that we need more research on what drives citizens to punish incumbents' undemocratic actions beyond partisanship and policy preferences.

# Conclusion

Our analysis shows that populists in government are indeed a danger to judicial independence, as depicted in many recent writings [@Arato.2019; @Scheppele.2019; @Muller.2016]. But, different to our expectations we do not find that this is less the case if the public has high trust in the judiciary. Indeed, our results imply that government officials are not worried enough about a public backlash to constrain their actions, independent of them being populist or not.

Our findings contribute to the on-going debate about democratic backsliding with a focus on the erosion of judicial independence. By looking at 40 states across Europe and Latin America, we show that high trust in the judiciary alone does not create a shield that protects the institution. While we find the expected effect that trust decreases the likelihood of governments undermining judicial independence between countries, we do not find any evidence that an increase in trust in the judiciary within a country has an effect on the likelihood of court purges and packing or attacks on the judiciary more generally.

This is in line with recent findings that highlight voters' willingness to trade of judicial independence for other factors such as economic growth, partisanship or policy congruence [@Driscoll.2023b; @GRAHAM.2020; @Lewandowsky.2023]. Of course, our analysis does not allow any inferences about the distinct mechanisms behind this finding. Our findings indicate that the missing effect of citizens values on executive behavior, that many papers have found in survey experiments in different countries, might be a global phenomenon.

| Clarification: The second and third response categories permit you to distinguish among limited arbitrary removals (i.e., when only a few judges are targeted) by the political importance of the removal. For example, you may consider the arbitrary removal of a few high court judges as more important than the arbitrary removal of a few lower court judges. |
