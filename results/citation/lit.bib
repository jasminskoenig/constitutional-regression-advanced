@article{AbouChadi.2020,
 abstract = {ABSTRACTThe dramatic decline in vote shares on the mainstream left in many recent elections has led to a renewed discussion about a crisis of Social Democracy. One popular argument is that Social Democratic decline is the result of these parties' liberal cultural positions and pro-EU stance, with both topics increasingly salient for their traditional voters, particularly among the working class. However, we lack comparative evidence testing this argument. In this paper, we combine CHES data on party positions with ESS survey data to analyze the electoral effects of Social Democratic parties' second dimension and EU positions. In addition, we focus on whether support from different socio-economic groups is sensitive to these positions. In contrast to much public debate, we find that more authoritarian/nationalist and more anti-EU positions are if anything associated with lower rather than greater electoral support for social democratic parties.},

 abstract = {WICHTIG

BESTE POPULISMUS DEFINITION

SCHMITT



This article provides a comparative conceptual analysis of the logic of populism and the logic of (constitutional) democracy.Populism is defined as a thin-centered ideology which advocates the sovereign rule of the people as a homogeneous body.The logic of this ideology is further developed in reference to the work ofCarl Schmitt and is shown to generate all the characteristics typically ascribed to populism. The logic of democracy is analyzed on the basis of the work of Claude Lefort and defined as a regime in which the locus of power remains an empty place. This analysis replaces the widespread model of constitutional democracy as a paradoxical combination of a constitutional and a democratic pillar. This two-pillar model fails to appreciate the internal coherence and some of the main features of the (constitutional) democratic logic. Thereby, the two-pillar approach gives rise to an understanding of populism as continuous with the democratic promise ofconstitutional democracy. In contrast, our analysis explains populism as the closure of the empty place of democracy. This highlights the antagonistic discontinuity between the logic of populism and the logic of democracy.},

@book{Acemoglu.2006,
 abstract = {This book develops a framework for analyzing the creation and consolidation of democracy. Different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Thus democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens, but opposed by elites. Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable when citizens can threaten social disorder and revolution. In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization},

@article{Akkerman.2003,
 abstract = {The recent success of radical right-wing parties in Western democracies is quite amazing, given their unimpressive history in the post-war period. These new parties are sometimes referred to as `populist' parties. It is not surprising then that this wave of populist politics has incited a renewed academic interest in populism as an empirical phenomenon and in populism as a concept. I will first look at the definitions of populism, as there is no consensus among the authors under review what parties are to be labelled populist. It is, for instance, not evident that the Dutch LPF is a populist party. Then I will discuss the explanations provided for the success of the new parties in Western democracies. I will argue that the focus is generally too confined to strictly social--economic and political factors. The role of the media and particularly of entrepreneurship should be taken into account in order to explain the success of populist parties. Finally, I will address the pros and cons of populism as an ideology. I will probe the arguments that populism is a challenge to democracy and conclude that the authors under review are too soft on populism.},

@article{Akkerman.2012,
 abstract = {Radical right parties are becoming increasingly likely candidates to participate in government coalitions in Western Europe. Comparative research on the electoral performance of these parties in government is still scarce. Our overview of the electoral effects of government participation of six parties in national governments shows that they do not run a higher risk of losing votes after government participation than other parties. There is considerable variation, however. Some radical right parties experienced great losses, while others won additional support. Focusing on the ways in which radical right parties conducted themselves in government, we explore why some parties won votes and others lost in post-incumbency elections. We compare their policy achievements with regard to immigration and integration policies, the performance of their ministers, and the party coherence of the six parties in office. Our analysis shows that policy records do not fully explain the variation in post-incumbency electoral results. Weak performance and internal party conflict prevent parties from credibly laying claim to the policy achievements of coalition governments and demonstrate that some of these parties were not ready for office.},

@misc{Anastasia.2020,
 abstract = {In this article we present a general interpretation of the recent tendency of Italian political forces to promote laws in the criminal field aimed more at producing political consensus of an emotional kind than at addressing real legal and social needs. In particular we'll demonstrate how the social trend could be classified as 'populist punitiveness', which has become stronger with the so-called populist turn of the Italian political system during the early 90s of the last century, and how it has become a permanent trait of the neo-populist forces that have dominated the Italian political scene for the past twenty-five years. In particular, we will analyse the government formed by the Northern League and the 5 Star Movement, also called the yellow-green government, headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in power from June 2018 to September 2019. We will highlight how some of the most significant criminal laws have followed a general pattern that corresponds to a punitive vision of society, aimed at fostering feelings of fear and protection that are irrational rather than grounded. Our thesis is that the neo-populist turn of the Italian system has not only profoundly transformed the system and political structures of the country but also civil society and the public opinion, rebalancing entire spheres of the Italian social and political system.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT The Great Recession triggered an unprecedented level of political turmoil in Greece, leading to a major readjustment of the party system and the near disappearance of the once mighty socialists of PASOK. Gradually, SYRIZA ? a radical-leftist-turned-populist party ? rose to become the key electoral player under the aegis of its young and popular leader, Alexis Tsipras. SYRIZA eventually won two general elections in 2015 and ruled together with the populist radical right Independent Greeks (ANEL) as junior partner, a coalition of great analytical significance, representing the first ever governing alliance of left-wing and right-wing populist parties in Europe. This contribution investigates reactions to the SYRIZA-ANEL government, giving special emphasis to measures undertaken by domestic and external actors. A key finding that warrants further research is that, under the same conditions of economic crisis that bring populists to power, economic institutions and material constraints can play an important role in taming populist actors and socializing them into the standard rules of the liberal democratic regime.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACTWe identify three gaps that limit the utility and obstruct the progress of computational text analysis methods (CTAM) for social science research. First, we contend that CTAM development has prioritized technological over validity concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch between CTAMs? focus on extracting specific contents and document-level patterns, and social science researchers? need for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text. Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly communities examining languages other than English. We substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of methodological work in the computational social sciences, as well as an inventory of leading research publications using quantitative textual analysis. Subsequently, we discuss implications of these three gaps for social scientists? uneven uptake of CTAM, as well as the field of computational social science text research as a whole. Finally, we propose a research agenda intended to bridge the identified gaps and improve the validity, utility, and inclusiveness of CTAM.},

 abstract = {What motivates political actors with diverging interests to respect the Supreme Court's authority? A popular answer is that the public serves as the guardian of judicial independence by punishing elected officials who undermine the justices. Curbing the Court challenges this claim, presenting a new theory of how we perceive the Supreme Court. Bartels and Johnston argue that, contrary to conventional wisdom, citizens are not principled defenders of the judiciary. Instead, they seek to limit the Court's power when it suits their political aims, and this inclination is heightened during times of sharp partisan polarization. Backed by a wealth of observational and experimental data, Bartels and Johnston push the conceptual, theoretical, and empirical boundaries of the study of public opinion of the courts. By connecting citizens to the strategic behavior of elites, this book offers fresh insights into the vulnerability of judicial institutions in an increasingly contentious era of American politics.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

 abstract = {This article considers Hungary's political system from 2010 to 2014 with Fidesz in power and domestic and international actors? responses to the challenge of populists-in-government. The article argues that domestic responses were weakened by Fidesz? use of its supermajority for a partisan redrafting of the country's constitutional order, but also by its mainstream competitors? failure to offer a contrasting yet positive vision for the electorate. External actors, and the European Union (EU) in particular, may therefore have emerged as the main bulwark against the effects of populists-in-government. However, the EU was relatively ill-equipped to deal with systemic violations of the common values of the Union with respect to its member states, and arguably even the available measures were not used to their full potential. The main explanation for this lies in Fidesz? origins: rather than starting its life on the fringes of the electoral space, the party had been the major, mainstream centre-right alternative. This position in Hungary's party system had in turn endowed Fidesz with strong transnational links which outlasted the party's own transformation and continued to act to dampen EU action.},

This includes previously excluded features such as parts of speech and a measure of word rarity derived from dynamic term frequencies in the Google Books data set.

This work contributes to this debate by analysing the extent to which positive parliamentarism, the prime minister?s parliamentary dissolution powers, the government?s power to table votes of confidence and the majority requirements for votes of no confidence serve as ?shock absorbers? moderating the effect of ideological polarisation in European parliaments. Fitting several Cox Proportional Hazards models to data for 752 cabinets from 28 European democracies between 1945 and 2019, the well-established finding that the restrictiveness of the constructive vote of no confidence mitigates the destabilising effect of strong extreme parties on non-electoral cabinet replacements is confirmed. More counter-intuitively, the absence of positive parliamentarism reduces the risk of non-electoral cabinet replacements when ideologically extreme parties are strong.},

To what extent would they be able to influence policy-making? Do they really weight upon public decision-making? While the literature on populism and radical right populist parties (RRPP) is abundant, few authors have addressed the relationship between populist promises and policy-making. Yet it is crucial to assess the influence of RRPP nowadays. This article investigates the influence of a most likely case ? the Schweizerische Volkspartei (SVP) ? on law and order policy-making. The focus is set on a traditional policy sector and on a party with a long institutionalized participation in power. Based on process-tracing, the results show that the SVP influence varies according to the stages of policy-making and to its instruments. Agenda-setting is more significantly influenced, and popular initiatives are an important component of the populist strategy. Results may be generalized to different countries beyond the Swiss case, as shown in the discussion and the conclusion.},

 abstract = {Over the last three decades, numerous radical right populist parties (RRPP) have emerged, developed, and strengthened their electoral weight in Western Europe. Yet, while several RRPP have managed to formally participate in government coalitions (such as in Italy, Austria, and Switzerland) or to informally support minority governments (such as in Denmark, and in The Netherlands) and while other RRPP have become highly visible opposition forces (such as in France, and Germany), the influence exercised by RRPP remain underexplored. It is essential to focus on their policy influence because of their electoral strength but also because they are often perceived by journalists, citizens, policy-makers as well as by researchers as a threat to democracy. As a reaction, mainstream parties tend to adopt specific strategies - such as measures of militant democracy towards RRPP. 0The aim of this book is to contribute to theoretical and empirical research in political science by bringing together a variety of contributions about the influence of RRPP in terms of policies on their core issues. To that end, we ask under which circumstances these parties are able to do so in contemporary Western Europe. This book proposes to focus on the role played by party status. Are RRPP better able to leave their imprints when they are in power or support minority governments than when they hold opposition or outsider status in Western Europe?},

@article{Blokker.2019d,
 abstract = {Populist constitutionalism is an increasingly discussed topic, but so far the analysis of the interrelation between populism and constitutionalism lacks a more systematic and comparative approach, able to bring out significant variety. Most of the recent literature on the phenomenon focuses on (right-wing) populism as a threat to constitutional democracy. This Article sets out to contribute to a more comparative and comprehensive discussion of the relation between varieties of populism---situated on a continuum from left- to right-wing, but also from national to transnational---with varieties of constitutional projects. The objective of this Article is threefold. First, I argue that it is problematic to consider legal constitutionalism as exhausting the possibilities of constitutionalism. Second, if populism is reduced to right-wing projects and as an unequivocal threat to liberal democracy, it becomes difficult to distinguish between dissimilar manifestations of populist projects, in particular regarding constituent politics. Third, while hardly any attention has been paid to constitutionalism and populist claims on the transnational level, in the European context, transnational forms of populism and constituent politics manifest themselves frequently, articulating an incisive critique on the European constitutional and political status quo, and contributing to a re-imagination and democratization of the European constitutional reality.},

@article{Blokker.2020c,
 abstract = {The main argument is that the contemporary manifestations of right-wing populism in Europe ought to be understood, at least in part, as reactions to a distinctive form of postwar European society, which I will call here embedded constitutional democracy. The argument is that the populist reaction to embedded constitutional democracy generally takes a conservative form. This conservatism is expressed in rather different ways (ranging from ethnoreligious views to 'illiberal liberal' ones), but at the same time populism displays a shared core of criticisms on liberalism, and in particular regarding the internationalized or global version of liberalism. In the article, I will start with a brief analysis of the emergence of postwar society in the form of embedded constitutional democracy, used as a backcloth for the subsequent discussion of critical views of liberal understandings of the law in conservative populist thinking. I will, then, focus on populists' critical views of liberalism and 'globalism', analyzed in the form of contemporary articulations of (conservative) populism in both East-Central Europe (Hungary and Poland), and Western Europe (France, Italy, the Netherlands). In order to identify ideological affinities and critical positions, I discuss four themes: abstractness and inauthenticity, identity threat, domination, and legal fundamentalism.},

 abstract = {The judicial role is based on knowledge, responsibility and integrity. How can it be that although I am entitled to send people to jail I need to get special permission to deal with the media?-- Israeli judge, interview, April 12, 2007This statement by one of the senior judges in the Israeli court system reflects the increasing frustration felt by judges about current media policy that requires prior approval of the Chief Justice or the intervention of the spokesperson of the Judicial Authority for virtually all communication between judges and journalists. Despite changes in the organizational structure of the information services of the courts, and increasing concern for the image of the courts in the media and its potential effect on public trust in the courts, the basic policy of judicial distance from the media and the ethos of ``letting the decisions speak for themselves'' still dominate within the Israeli legal establishment (Peleg and Bogoch 2014).This chapter will describe the current status of judicial-media relations in Israel, including the changes that have occurred over time, as well as the unintended consequences of the court's media policy. It is based on both publicly available material from the Judicial Authority's Information Services, as well as information conveyed to us by the spokesperson, press statements by judges and reporters, recent research on the media coverage of the court, and interviews conducted with 40 presently serving and retired judges and justices and 30 journalists. First, we will describe the Israeli judicial system and the research on the media coverage of the courts in this country. Next, we will present the structure and organization of the Judicial Authority Information Services, and the changes that have occurred over time in the court-media relationship, including the reaction of the Judicial Authority to technological changes. Finally we will discuss the unintended consequences of the court's media policy, and the dilemmas that these have triggered among both journalists and judges.},

What determines the occurrence of revolutions, often leading to left-wing dictatorships, such as the Soviet regime? Although a large literature has developed since Aristotle through contemporary political science to answer these questions, we still lack a convincing understanding of the process of political development. Employing analytical tools borrowed from game theory, Carles Boix offers a complete theory of political transitions, in which political regimes ultimately hinge on the nature of economic assets, their distribution among individuals, and the balance of power among different social groups. Backed up by detailed historical work and extensive statistical analysis that goes back to the mid-nineteenth century, this 2003 book explains why democracy emerged in classical Athens. It also discusses the early triumph of democracy in both nineteenth-century agrarian Norway, Switzerland and northeastern America and the failure in countries with a powerful landowning class},

 abstract = {[Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.]},

Yet there has long existed empirical support to conclude that the U.S. Supreme Court has been responsive to the public's mood. In this article, we consider?in a new environment, and at a more direct level?whether public opinion can act as a mechanism to spur judicial decision-making and shape court-legislative interactions. In particular, we leverage the ability of parliamentary opposition groups in many countries to file legal challenges directly to the constitutional court through the abstract review process. Overall, we find a strong indication that these high court judges do respond in an indirect way to the general public will, overturning cases more often and agreeing with the parliament less often when public approval is shifting away from the parliamentary majority and toward the opposition.},

To test these theories, we conducted unique field experiments in cooperation with sitting politicians in which U.S. state legislators sent constituents official communications with randomly assigned content. The legislators sometimes stated their issue positions in these letters, sometimes supported by extensive arguments but sometimes minimally justified; in many cases, these issue positions were at odds with voters'. An ostensibly unrelated survey found that voters often adopted the positions legislators took, even when legislators offered little justification. Moreover, voters did not evaluate their legislators more negatively when representatives took positions these voters had previously opposed, again regardless of whether legislators provided justifications. The findings are consistent with theories suggesting voters often defer to politicians' policy judgments.]},

@article{Bryan.2016,
 abstract = {ABSTRACTKey questions in American politics are whether and why the Supreme Court is responsive to public opinion. Past scholarship has suggested a strong relationship between changes in public opinion and the ideological direction of the Court?s decisions. Here we focus on a slightly different question and examine why justices are willing to follow public opinion, even at the expense of their own ideological preferences. To this end we examine whether justices are willing to vote contrary to their preferences when those preferences are out of step with prevailing public opinion. We employ a novel issue-specific measure of public mood, and we find that justices follow public opinion to shore up broader institutional approval. But the constraint of public opinion is not static over time. Rather, justices are uniquely responsive to public opinion when public support for the Court is low or case salience is high.},

Both in Hungary and Poland, the populist forces relatively easily undermined the rule of law and democracy, and steered politics in a dangerous authoritarian direction. Ultimately, democratic political parties with credible political ideas and platforms offer the best hope for protection of liberal democracy. As the Western European examples show, as long as there exist credible liberal political platforms, the threat to the rule of law and democracy is not existential. While populists in Western Europe challenge certain liberal values and policies, they lack the capacity to threaten the essence of liberal democracy.},

@article{Caldeira.1992,
 abstract = {[The Supreme Court, like all political institutions, requires some minimal level of support because, as the high bench performs its political and constitutional roles, the justices must on occasion stand against the winds of public opinion. With data from a recent national survey, we reexamine the levels, sources, and explanations of public support for the Supreme Court. Since racial differences in attitudes toward the Court are so great, we focus here only on the attitudes of white U.S. citizens. Our purposes are both substantive and methodological. On the substantive front, we examine changes in the etiology of support. We investigate the traditional explanations of diffuse support, but, more important, we introduce and evaluate the power of a new set of variables, political values. These political values do an uncommonly good job of predicting attitudes toward the Court. In addition, we devote particular attention to the important role of {\textquotedbl}opinion leaders{\textquotedbl} as supporters of the Court. These leaders relate to the Court in a fashion very different from that of the mass public. On the methodological front, we offer an alternative means of thinking about and capturing diffuse support for the Court among the mass public. We close with speculations about the process by which diffuse support for the Court changes over time and, more generally, the implications of attitudes among the mass public and opinion leaders for the functioning of the Supreme Court.]},

@article{Chatsiou.,
 abstract = {Political science, and social science in general, have traditionally been using computational methods to study areas such as voting behavior, policy making, international conflict, and international development. More recently, increasingly available quantities of data are being combined with improved algorithms and affordable computational resources to predict, learn, and discover new insights from data that is large in volume and variety. New developments in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and, more generally, artificial intelligence (AI) are opening up new opportunities for testing theories and evaluating the impact of interventions and programs in a more dynamic and effective way. Applications using large volumes of structured and unstructured data are becoming common in government and industry, and increasingly also in social science research. This chapter offers an introduction to such methods drawing examples from political science. Focusing on the areas where the strengths of the methods coincide with challenges in these fields, the chapter first presents an introduction to AI and its core technology - machine learning, with its rapidly developing subfield of deep learning. The discussion of deep neural networks is illustrated with the NLP tasks that are relevant to political science. The latest advances in deep learning methods for NLP are also reviewed, together with their potential for improving information extraction and pattern recognition from political science texts.},

Studying the co-sponsorship and contents of parliamentary questions and roll-call vote cohesion of PRR representatives in the European Parliament from 2009 to 2019, we examine the extent and substance of their joint polity-based contestation of European integration. Our findings indicate that overall levels of PRR cooperation remain low and concentrated within European party groups, suggesting that ideological divergences between PRR actors and their institutional fragmentation within the EP still hamper their formal cooperation at the European level. These insights feed into debates on the potential and limitations of transnational cooperation of PRR actors.},

@article{Clark.2009,
 abstract = {[A major focus of judicial politics research has been the extent to which ideological divergence between the Court and Congress can explain variation in Supreme Court decision making. However, conflicting theoretical and empirical findings have given rise to a significant discrepancy in the scholarship. Building on evidence from interviews with Supreme Court justices and former law clerks, I develop a formal model of judicial-congressional relations that incorporates judicial preferences for institutional legitimacy and the role of public opinion in congressional hostility towards the Supreme Court. An original dataset identifying all Court-curbing legislation proposed between 1877 and 2006 is then used to assess the influence of congressional hostility on the Court's use of judicial review. The evidence indicates that public discontent with the Court, as mediated through congressional hostility, creates an incentive for the Court to exercise self-restraint. When Congress is hostile, the Court uses judicial review to invalidate Acts of Congress less frequently than when Congress is not hostile towards the Court.]},

 abstract = {CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): We present a model in which we reformulate and extend Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (EVL) argument to examine the role of power in the relationship between states and their citizens. Our basic model and its various extensions reaffirm some of the ideas found in Hirschman's original analysis, but contradict several others. They also highlight several points that have been previously overlooked or underempha-sized by scholars employing the EVL framework to substantive areas in political science. After presenting the model and discussing its general implications, we apply it to the empirical case of democratic transi-tions. By explaining the observed relationship between (i) economic development and democracy and (ii) the abundance of natural resources and authoritarianism, our model is able to combine the results from two largely distinct literatures within the same theoretical framework. Our model also provides important insights for the literatures addressing the role of foreign aid, inequality, and economic performance in the democratization process.},

As this book reveals, the historic vote for Brexit marked the culmination of trends in domestic politics and in the UK's relationship with the EU that have been building over many years. Drawing on a wealth of survey evidence collected over more than ten years, this book explains why most people decided to ignore much of the national and international community and vote for Brexit. Drawing on past research on voting in major referendums in Europe and elsewhere, a team of leading academic experts analyse changes in the UK's party system that were catalysts for the referendum vote, including the rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), the dynamics of public opinion during an unforgettable and divisive referendum campaign, the factors that influenced how people voted and the likely economic and political impact of this historic decision},

 abstract = {Which U.S. Supreme Court cases are deemed newsworthy enough to appear on the front page of a major newspaper? Which are covered, but do not appear on the front page, and which are not covered at all? We answer these questions using a unique data set of newspaper coverage of Supreme Court cases in four newspapers from 1953 to 2004?a data set spanning more than 6,200 observations, 25 natural courts, and the tenure of three Chief Justices. We find that the overall proportion of Supreme Court cases covered has declined over this period (from a peak of nearly 100{\%}), although the proportion of cases on the front page has remained more constant. The results of a selection model also suggest that, in the aggregate, coverage patterns on the front page are explained by established norms of newsworthiness, but coverage elsewhere in the paper often follows different criteria. When examining different newspapers in isolation, we also find that individual papers do vary, to a limited degree, in their selection of newsworthy cases. These results are important for those concerned about citizen information about politics, the relationship between the courts and the public, and media gatekeeping.},

The author first discusses why polarization is important to study. Second, the author provides a new measurement of party system polarization based on voter perceptions of party positions in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, which includes more than 50 separate elections from established and developing democracies. Third, the author compares party polarization and party fractionalization as influences on cleavage-based and ideological voting and as predictors of turnout levels. The finding is that party polarization is empirically more important in explaining these outcomes.},

 abstract = {In recent years the creeping deterioration of democratic rule worldwide has become a major preoccupation across a wide range of research fields and disciplines---especially public law and political science---as scholars struggle to understand the nature of evolving threats to a broad range of democratic systems. Many terms are now used to refer to the incremental degradation of democratic rule worldwide, or `democratic decay'. Abusive constitutionalism. Autocratic legalism. Populist constitutionalism. Bad faith constitutionalism. De-constitutionalism. Constitutional retrogression. Constitutional capture. Constitutional rot. Constitutional decay. Democratic deconsolidation. Democratic backsliding. Authoritarianisation. Authoritarian backsliding. Rule of law backsliding. Democratic erosion. Democratic recession. The list goes on. This article argues that conceiving of this scattered cross-disciplinary literature as a research field and providing an account of recent conceptual development can help to map a rapidly developing landscape, maximise the analytical utility of key concepts, identify resonances and duplication among concepts and across discrete literatures, and can help to ensure that this emerging quasi-field develops in a more coherent and rigorous manner.},

@book{Delledonne.2020b,
 abstract = {This edited volume explores the relationship between constitutionalism and populism in the Italian context. Italian populism is of interest to comparative lawyers for many reasons. Firstly, the country has a long-lasting tradition of anti-parliamentarism over the course of its history as a unitary state. After the 2018 general election, it has turned into the first European country in which two self-styled populist parties formed a coalition government. Although it collapsed in August 2019, many issues that it had raised remain. Secondly, as Italy is a founding member of the European Communities, the constitutional implications of populist politics have to be considered not only within the national framework but also in a wider context. This book argues that the relationship between populism and constitutionalism should not be seen in terms of mutual exclusion and perfect opposition. Indeed, populism frequently relies on concepts and categories belonging to the language of constitutionalism (majority, democracy, people), offering a kind of constitutional counter-narrative.

 abstract = {ABSTRACTBetween 1974 and 2005, a majority of states became democratic for the first time in history. However, a global democratic recession began in 2006 and has persisted ? and deepened ? over the past 14 years. Not only have average levels of freedom (or democratic quality) been declining globally and in most parts of the world, but the pace of democratic breakdown accelerated and the number of democratic transitions declined, particularly in the past five years. Democratic regression is particularly visible among the G-20 countries and other most populous and geopolitically weighty countries, 19 of which have declined in freedom during the democratic recession, with only two improving. The principal method of democratic regression has been incremental strangulation of democracy by elected (typically populist) executives who gradually eviscerate institutional checks, political opposition, independent media, and other forces of scrutiny and resistance in civil society. Weak and declining rule of law has predisposed regimes to democratic regression, enabling ambitious rulers to hollow out political competition. But international factors have also been crucial, generating common economic and social stresses while lifting the constraints and lowering the risks autocrats face as they inaugurate or accelerate the slide into authoritarianism.},

 abstract = {Collective choice rules are used to aggregate individual preferences among alternatives in order to determine group preference. Marketers frequently measure and aggregate customer preferences for product design. They have traditionally used aggregation rules like the plurality method, the Condorcet method, approval voting, the Borda method, and the utilitarian method. While marketers have extensively utilized these rules, only recently have they paid some attention to the strengths and weaknesses of these rules. Arrow has investigated the desirable properties of aggregation rules. This article presents Arrow's conditions that a desirable preference aggregation method should satisfy and his ``General Impossibility Theorem.'' Five methods of preference aggregation are then evaluated in the light of Arrow's theorem.},

Specifically, it investigates the radical right's influence on migration control, migrant integration, citizenship and asylum policy. While previous studies have often credited the Austrian radical right with policy influence, it is argued that such work ignores both the problematic adjustment of the radical right to public office and the insights of immigration policy theory. By integrating these criticisms into the analysis, it is argued that although immigration policy was restrictive, the policies pursued did not deviate too greatly from past and subsequent government policy nor with the policies being implemented elsewhere in Europe. Furthermore, the radical right's influence on immigration policy was limited by the role of intra-coalition dynamics and the moderating effect of the policy process.},

 abstract = {CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): What determines the success by which heads of government can enact their legislative proposals? Presumably, constitutional rules governing the relationship between executives and legislatures should be part of the answer. We suggest that in order to understand an executive's leverage in legislative bargaining, one must consider a broad set of formal powers, even those that are not directly related to the normal legislative process. Many of these ancillary powers function effectively as outside options, in that they provide substitute channels of legislating or serve as punitive devices with which to discipline the opposing party. Either way, these powers can increase leverage in bargaining by increasing the costs for the opposing party of failing to reach agreement. We test aspects of this theory with recently collected cross-sectional historical data on bill passage and on the constitutional powers of executives and legislatures. Our findings suggest that the legislative clout of executives is significantly enhanced by the presence of such outside options. An important reference point in this debate is the classic conceptualization of executives and legislative systems as either presidential or parliamentary. In this respect, we find that the effect of outside options significantly outweighs any effect of presidentialism and parliamentarism on the legislative success of executives. 1},

This provocative book argues that, very often, common sense fails. Sometimes it is simply the case that less is more; people may benefit from being constrained in their options or from being ignorant. The three long essays that constitute this book revise and expand the ideas developed in Jon Elster's classic study Ulysses and the Sirens. It is not simply a new edition of the earlier book, though; many of the issues merely touched on before are explored here in much more detail. Elster shows how seemingly disparate examples which limit freedom of action reveal similar patterns, so much so that he proposes a new field of study: constraint theory.

Additionally, an analysis of congressional attention to criminal justice issues supports the argument that the public's attitudes have led, not followed, political elites.]},

 abstract = {[What role do courts play in the establishment and maintenance of constitutional democracies? To address this question, we elaborate a model that draws on existing substantive literature and on theories that assume strategic behavior on the part of judges, executives, and legislatures. This model, in turn, leads to several behavioral predictions about the interactions among the relevant political actors. Although those predictions could be assessed in many distinct contexts, we focus on Russia. In particular, we provide a demonstration of how the model helps make sense of the behavior of the Constitutional Court (Konstitucjonnyj sud) in light of the difficult political situation it confronted. We conclude with some thoughts on the broader implications of our theory for the study of courts throughout Eastern Europe and how it may well illuminate constitutional politics in other parts of the world.]},

 abstract = {While there is a well-established literature on measuring political polarization in two-party systems, relational approaches to polarization in multiparty systems are still very limited. In this paper we develop a network-based approach for measuring perceived party polarization in survey studies that is suitable for multiparty systems. Our approach is based on cognitive social structures design. We generate a cognitive political network for each respondent in a nationally representative survey in Turkey by asking respondents their perceived ties among all possible dyadic relations among major political parties. From these networks we calculate multiple whole network measures that may be reasonable proxies for perceived party polarization. We compare our approach with the Left-Right political ideology distance scale commonly used in survey studies. Our analyses show that the association between our measure and the Left-Right ideological distance is limited. The cognitive political network approach may be a flexible and a direct alternative for measuring political phenomena in survey studies such as perceived party polarization in multiparty contexts.},

In the first section, a general and analytic exploration of populist phenomena will be drawn, by focusing on the so-called thesis of a `populist' constitutionalism. In the second part, Tushnet's arguments for a populist constitutionalism will be presented, through the analysis of his two main contributions: Taking the Constitution Away from the Courts, in which Tushnet develops his critique of legal constitutionalism and judicial review as an undemocratic power by unelected justices, and Authoritarian Constitutionalism, a recent article in which Tushnet distinguishes between `authoritarian' and `populist' definitions of constitutionalism. In conclusion, such arguments will be discussed, by proposing a critical response to Tushnet's position and presenting some risks of a majoritarian and populist constitutional democracy.},

Specifically, it investigates the effectiveness of strategies aimed at ostracizing populist actors versus ?defanging? them through incorporation in public office. The article finds that turning the FP{\"O} into a pariah has not been effective in moderating the party or curbing its success. Incorporation in public office has been more effective, however, leading to the near collapse of the FP{\"O} and the split of the party. Yet, the cause for such an outcome may be found less in the strategy itself by imposing some intrinsic mechanism of moderation but rather in the incompetence and inexperience of populist party politicians unfamiliar with public office. Exclusionary strategies have also the undesirable effect of playing into the narrative of populist actors of being persecuted by the political establishment thereby offering them another means of mobilization. The article concludes that the revival of the FP{\"O} shows that no strategy can yield lasting success unless the demand-side causes underlying radical right-wing populism are addressed.},

@article{FallonRichardHJr.2018,
 abstract = {We live in a time of anxiety about the rule of law. In railing against individual judges and their decisions, angry protesters-including elected officials and the President-presume a knowledge of what the Constitution requires, judicial pronouncements to the contrary notwithstanding. Recent bluster raises a question about what would occur if the President ordered government officials to defy a judicial ruling. The idea that the Supreme Court has ultimate authority in matters of constitutional interpretation-which often rides under the heading of {\textquotedbl}judicial supremacy{\textquotedbl}-has acquired strong currency. In the history of American political ideas, it has substantially eclipsed {\textquotedbl}departmentalist{\textquotedbl} theories, which hold that each branch of government should interpret the Constitution for itself, and an allied notion of {\textquotedbl}popular constitutionalism.{\textquotedbl} In the view of many, the rule of law requires judicial supremacy. This Article probes the concepts of judicial supremacy, departmentalism, popular constitutionalism, and the rule of law, all of which possess relatively timeless importance. In doing so, it sheds light on issues of immediate practical urgency. The truth, terrifyingly enough under current circumstances, is that our system is not, never has been, and probably never could be one of pure judicial supremacy. In principle, moreover, a regime in which judicial review operates within {\textquotedbl}politically constructed bounds{\textquotedbl}-and judicial rulings on constitutional issues are at risk of occasional defiance-is entirely compatible with rule-of-law ideals. In our current political context, there is abundant ground for anxiety about the future of rule-of-law constitutionalism. But judicial supremacy is not the answer to any significant legal, constitutional, or political problem. An adequate response will require repair of the ethical commitments-among elected officials and the public, as well as the Judicial Branch-that the rule of law requires.},

This volume investigates the nature of constitutional democratic government in the United States and elsewhere. The editors introduce a basic conceptual framework which the contributors clarify and develop in eleven essays organized into three separate sections. The first section deals with constitutional founding and the founders' use of cultural symbols and traditions to facilitate acceptance of a new regime. The second discusses alternative constitutional structures and their effects on political outcomes. The third focuses on processes of constitutional change and on why founders might choose to make formal amendments relatively difficult or easy to achieve. The book is distinctive because it provides comprehensive tools for analyzing and comparing different forms of constitutional democracy. These tools are discussed in ways that will be of interest to students and readers in political science, law, history and political philosophy},

@book{Friedman.2013,
 abstract = {In recent years, the justices of the Supreme Court have ruled definitively on such issues as abortion, school prayer, and military tribunals in the war on terror. They decided one of American history's most contested presidential elections. Yet for all their power, the justices never face election and hold their offices for life. This combination of influence and apparent unaccountability has led many to complain that there is something illegitimate'even undemocratic'about judicial authority. In The Will of the People, Barry Friedman challenges that claim by showing that the Court has always been subject to a higher power: the American public. Judicial positions have been abolished, the justices' jurisdiction has been stripped, the Court has been packed, and unpopular decisions have been defied. For at least the past sixty years, the justices have made sure that their decisions do not stray too far from public opinion. Friedman's pathbreaking account of the relationship between popular opinion and the Supreme Court'from the Declaration of Independence to the end of the Rehnquist court in 2005'details how the American people came to accept their most controversial institution and shaped the meaning of the Constitution.},

 abstract = {Word embeddings are a powerful machine-learning framework that represents each English word by a vector. The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts-e.g., the women's movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States-and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

@article{Gerschewski.2021,
 abstract = {ABSTRACTDemocratic regression has become a worrying phenomenon in the last years. Social science has provided a variety of explanations why democratic regimes have lost democratic regime quality. Against this backdrop, I take stock of the recent literature by putting forward two important analytical distinctions that we should make more explicit. First, I propose to classify our current explanations along the source where the cause for the malaise originated. By doing so, I introduce a distinction between erosion and decay type of arguments. While the former is a gradual process that is caused exogenously ? like wind or water hitting a stone ? the latter is caused endogenously ? like the half-life in nuclear decay processes. Second, I draw a distinction between the endogenous or exogenous roots of the cause and the subsequent causal mechanism that connects the cause with the outcome. I outline the need for dissecting a causal mechanism into its constitutive components and highlight its underlying dimensions of temporality. Throughout the article, I use empirical case material as well as relevant secondary literature to illustrate these points.},

@book{Gordon.1999,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}This book examines the development of the theory and practice of constitutionalism, defined as a political system in which the coercive power of the state is controlled through a pluralistic distribution of political power. It explores the main venues of constitutional practice in ancient Athens, Republican Rome, Renaissance Venice, the Dutch Republic, seventeenth-century England, and eighteenth-century America. From its beginning in Polybius' interpretation of the classical concept of mixed government, the author traces the theory of constitutionalism through its late medieval appearance in the Conciliar Movement of church reform and in the Huguenot defense of minority rights. After noting its suppression with the emergence of the nation-state and the Bodinian doctrine of sovereignty, the author describes how constitutionalism was revived in the English conflict between king and Parliament in the early Stuart era, and how it has developed since then into the modern concept of constitutional democracy.{\textquotedbl}--Jacket},

We find the U.S. public's viability as a democratic check to be strikingly limited: only a small fraction of Americans prioritize democratic principles in their electoral choices, and their tendency to do so is decreasing in several measures ofpolarization, including the strength ofpartisanship, policy extremism, and candidate platform divergence. Our findings echo classic arguments about the importance of political moderation and cross-cutting cleavages for democratic stability and highlight the dangers that polarization represents for democracy.},

 abstract = {Trust in judges is needed for voluntary acceptance of judicial decisions, and judicial transparency is thought to strengthen trust. It exposes the public to symbols that embrace a ?myth of legality? which is expected to have a positive effect on trust. We assess a specific understanding of transparency and trust by looking at the moderating effect of knowledge and predisposition to trust. We report on a field experiment which investigates the effect of a Dutch television series on trust. Findings show that judicial transparency indeed has a positive effect on trust. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that it has the strongest effects on individuals with medium prior knowledge about the judiciary. However, higher predisposition to trust mitigated the effect of transparency, indicating a ceiling effect. This sustains the idea that the unique traits of visual judicial transparency expose typical judicial symbols that imply that impartiality which increases trust in judges.},

@article{Halmai.2018,
 abstract = {The paper deals with recent deviations from the shared values of constitutionalism towards a kind of `populist, illiberal constitutionalism' introduced by Hungary's new constitution in 2011. The populism of FIDESZ was directed against all elites, including the ones that designed the 1989 constitutional system (in which FIDESZ also participated), claiming that it was time for a new revolution. This is why PM Viktor Orb{\'a}n characterized the results of the 2010 elections as a `revolution of the ballot boxes'. His intention with this revolution was to eliminate all checks and balances, and even the parliamentary rotation of governing parties. His vision for a new constitutional order---one in which his political party occupies the centre stage of Hungarian political life and puts an end to debates over values---has now been entrenched in the new constitution. The paper argues that this current Hungarian constitutional system was made possible by FIDESZ' anti-pluralist nationalist populism, but is not necessarily based on a true commitment to expressing the will of the people via `illiberal constitutionalism'. The populist government rather misuses the country's lack of constitutional culture. Adherence to constitutional patriotism would mean that FIDESZ would have to endorse what John Rawls once called `constitutional essentials'. The core of this kind of constitutional patriotism is a constitutional culture centred on universalist liberal democratic norms and values. Instead, the current Hungarian constitutional system is confronted with unconstitutional patriotism, a kind of nationalism that violates constitutional essentials in the name of `national constitutional identity'.},

@incollection{Harada.2017,
 abstract = {The headlines were unprecedented. ``Stephen Harper lashes out at top judge on Supreme Court''; ``Chief Justice hits back at Prime Minister over claim of improper call''; ``Duelling statements over Nadon appointment reveal PMO fight with top court.''Riveting as they were, they did not begin to capture the depth of the drama playing out in the nation's capital in May 2014 -- then- Prime Minister Stephen Harper issuing a statement suggesting Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin of the Supreme Court of Canada tried to engage him ``on a matter that is or may be'' before the court; the chief justice issuing her own counterstatement to categorically deny there was ever any such communication between her and the government. The spectacle played out for weeks, drawing in the opposition parties in Parliament, the Canadian legal community, and the news media. It spilled onto the global stage: the American College of Trial Lawyers supported McLachlin, as did the International Commission of Jurists, which investigated the available facts and concluded that Harper's criticism ``was not well-founded and amounted to an encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and integrity of the Chief Justice.''While surprising in its tone, the Conservative prime minister's eruption did not come out of the blue. It was ostensibly tied to the failed appointment of Marc Nadon, Harper's choice to fill one of three seats on the Supreme Court reserved for Quebec. Nadon was a semiretired Federal Court of Appeal judge with a track record regarded as unremarkable by commentators, save for a dissent in which he alone sided with the government in Khadr v. Canada (Prime Minister), involving the repatriation of a Canadian citizen imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. After the Nadon appointment was challenged, the Supreme Court was thrust into the political fray. In Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6 it was asked to clarify both the eligibility requirements for judges representing Quebec and the scope of Parliament's power to unilaterally change the court's composition. The majority's decision essentially disqualified Nadon. It was widely seen as a blow to the government of the day, which had moved to pass a law to try to ensure his eligibility.},

Based on content analyses of 1,496 party press releases and 6,512 media reports from the 2013 Austrian parliamentary election campaign, we show that media coverage of individual party messages is influenced not just by news factors, but also by partisan bias. The media are therefore more likely to report on messages from parties their readers favor. Importantly, this effect is greater rather than weaker when these messages have high news value. These findings have important implications for understanding the media's role in elections and representative democracies in general.},

 abstract = {Laypeople's beliefs about the current distribution of outcomes such as income and wealth in their country influence their attitudes toward issues ranging from taxation to healthcare - but how accurate are these beliefs? We review the burgeoning literature on (mis)perceptions of inequality. First, we show that people on average misperceive current levels of inequality, typically underestimating the extent of inequality in their country. Second, we delineate potential causes of these misperceptions, including people's overreliance on cues from their local environment, leading to their erroneous beliefs about both the overall distributions of wealth and income and their place in those distributions. Third, we document that these (mis)perceptions of inequality - but not actual levels of inequality - drive behavior and preferences for redistribution. More promisingly, we review research suggesting that correcting misperceptions influences preferences and policy outcomes.},

Grundlegend f{\"u}r die Norm ist die Einbeziehung der {\"O}ffentlichkeit bei gerichtlichen Verfahren. Im Zeitalter der Informationstechnologie, digitaler Medien und der Transformation dessen, was als {\"O}ffentlichkeit definiert werden kann, stellt sich die Frage nach der Offenheit neu: Welche Rolle spielen Gerichte angesichts der zunehmenden Privatisierung von Rechtsprechung? Wie ist das Spannungsverh{\"a}ltnis von Offenheit und populistischer Bewegungen zu bewerten, die die Unabh{\"a}ngigkeit der Justiz zu untergraben drohen? Die Autorinnen und Autoren bieten neue Ans{\"a}tze f{\"u}r Open Justice in Zeiten des Wandels.



The idea behind open justice, a principle widely recognised as a constituent of the rule of law and vital for the functioning of democratic societies, seems simple and universally accepted: a legal rule that requires courts to conduct their proceedings in public. However, it is less clear how we are to understand and implement this notion today. In the age of information technology, digital media and the transformation of the public sphere, this question merits careful consideration. In the face of the fast-changing landscape of dispute resolution and populist movements threatening to undermine judicial independence, what role should courts play in ensuring the degree of openness necessary to support the rule of law? Against this backdrop, this book seeks new approaches to the requirement for open justice in times of change, and revisits the place and role of courts in ensuring open justice in democratic societies. It offers a unique comparative insight thanks to a variety of approaches adopted by authors from diverse professional and academic backgrounds. Prof. Dr. Dres. h.c. Burkhard Hess is Director of the Max Planck Institute Luxembourg for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law, and a professor at both the Universit{\'e} du Luxembourg and the University of Heidelberg. Ana Koprivica Harvey, LL.M. is a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute Luxembourg for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.},

@article{Hirschl.2000,
 abstract = {[Drawing upon an analysis of the political vectors behind constitutional reform in Israel (1992), Canada (1982), New Zealand (1990), and South Africa (1993), the article suggests that the trend toward constitutionalization in culturally divided polities has not been adequately delineated by extant theories of constitutional transformation. An examination of the political origins of these four constitutional revolutions suggests that judicial empowerment is in many cases the consequence of a conscious strategy undertaken by threatened political and economic elites seeking to preserve their hegemony vis-a-vis the growing influence of {\textquotedbl}peripheral{\textquotedbl} groups in crucial majoritarian policymaking arenas. In response to perceived threats by peripheral groups, elites who possess disproportionate access to and influence upon the legal arena often initiate a constitutional entrenchment of rights in order to insulate policymaking from popular political pressure. Power is transferred from majoritarian decision-making arenas to national high courts, where they assume their policy preferences will find greater support. This process of conscious judicial empowerment is likely to occur (a) when the judiciary's public reputation for political impartiality and rectitude is relatively high and (b) when the courts are likely to rule, by and large, in accordance with the cultural propensities and policy preferences of the traditionally hegemonic elites. Under such conditions, increasing judicial intrusion into the prerogatives of the legislature and the executive through the constitutionalization of rights and the establishment of judicial review may provide an efficient short-term institutional solution for ruling elites, who given an erosion in their popular support, may find strategic drawbacks in adhering to majoritarian decision-making processes.]},

It also represents a convergence of different fields with different ways of thinking about and doing science. The goal of this Perspective is to provide some clarity around how these approaches differ from one another and to propose how they might be productively integrated. Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions-the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes-and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.},

However, no attention has been paid to the composition of European constitutional courts and how they make decisions. Do European judges exhibit political preferences as their US counterparts do? If so, it is important to know who selects the judges as the selection determines the outcome. This article analyses the composition of the German Bundesverfassungsgericht and the French Conseil constitutionnel. It tests the correlation between the party affiliation of the pivotal judge and oppositional success empirically for all abstract reviews filed between 1974 and 2002. In both countries the likelihood of an oppositional victory or defeat varies with the ideological position of the pivotal judge. This leads to the conclusion that European judges decide on the basis of their political preferences like their US counterparts.},

It draws on findings of qualitative work on this question as well as a theoretical framework by Cas Mudde and Crist{\'o}bal Rovira Kaltwasser to test whether the assumptions and results of both are applicable in a comparative study. It is expected that populist actors have a negative impact on democratic quality when they are in government, but that they positively influence democratic quality when they are in opposition, where they can function as a corrective. Further, it is expected that these effects vary depending on the level of consolidation. A linear mixed-effects model and data from eighteen Latin American countries in the period 1995?2009 was used to evaluate the hypotheses. Generally, it was found that populist actors in opposition have a large positive influence on democratic quality and that populist actors in government have a negative influence.},

We build on both, theoretical work and qualitative evaluations on the influence of populism on democratic quality. We follow Cas Mudde and Cristob{\'a}l Rovira Kaltwasser's (2012) distinction between populism in government and populism in opposition. We expect populism in opposition to function as a~corrective. That is to say, it acts as a~``drunken guest'' who blurts out painful truths (e. g. issues which are ignored by other parties or shortcomings of policy outputs). In government, however, it is likely to harm democratic quality since it does not respect the rules of public contestation (e. g. undermining the legitimacy of democratic institutions). Furthermore, we contend that the effect's size is moderated by the level of consolidation, and in the case of PRRPs in government, by the specific type of government.},

@article{Huber.2023,
 abstract = {Recently, scholars of populism have increasingly started to theorise and capture susceptibility to populism at the individual level. Most of these studies, however, focus on the consequences of populist attitudes on political behaviour. Less attention has been paid to the question of which citizens have high levels of populist attitudes and why. While some scholars argue that populist attitudes more resemble an unchangeable personality trait, meaning that individuals may be more or less populist, others argue that it is a{\&}nbsp;response to outside grievances or discontent. The latter suggests that levels of populist attitudes are dynamic and may change if grievances are addressed (or remain unaddressed). We contribute to this literature by asking how discontent fuelled by unfulfilled policy preferences affects the level of populist attitudes. Following the conception of populism as a{\&}nbsp;thin-centred ideology, we argue that high levels of populist attitudes are not connected with certain issues per se. Rather, our argument is that people are more populist when they feel poorly represented on policy issues that they care strongly about. This argument provides an explanation for the observation that even voters of non-populist parties sometimes show high levels of populist attitudes. We test the impact of policy discontent on populist attitudes using data from the GLES 2021 Pre-Election Cross Section survey by combining information on citizens' issue specific discontent with the perceived salience of respective issues. The results are in line with our expectations: Individuals with higher policy discontent are more populist.},

@article{Huq.2018,
 abstract = {Is the United States at risk of democratic backsliding? And would the Constitution prevent such decay? To many, the 2016 election campaign and the conduct of newly installed President Donald Trump may be the immediate catalyst for these questions. But structural changes to the socioeconomic environment and geopolitical shifts are what make the question a truly pressing one. Eschewing a focus on current events, this Article develops a taxonomy of different threats of democratic backsliding, the mechanisms whereby they unfold, and the comparative risk of each threat in the contemporary moment. By drawing on comparative law and politics experience, we demonstrate that there are two modal paths of democratic decay. We call these authoritarian reversion and constitutional retrogression. A reversion is a rapid and near-complete collapse of democratic institutions. Retrogression is a more subtle, incremental erosion to three institutional predicates of democracy occurring simultaneously: competitive elections; rights of political speech and association; and the administrative and adjudicative rule of law. We show that over the past quarter-century, the risk of reversion in democracies around the world has declined, whereas the risk of retrogression has spiked. The United States is neither exceptional nor immune from these changes. We evaluate the danger of retrogression as clear and present here (and elsewhere), whereas we think reversion is much less likely. We further demonstrate that the constitutional safeguards against retrogression are weak. The nearterm prospects of constitutional liberal democracy hence depend less on our institutions than on the qualities of political leadership, popular resistance, and the quiddities of partisan coalitional politics.},

@incollection{Ingram.2017,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe Brazilian Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal, STF) is widely regarded as one of the more powerful high, constitutional tribunals in Latin America (Brinks 2005; Taylor 2008; Nunes 2010; Kapiszewski 2012). This power is often understood in terms of the effects of court decisions, effects which have been expanding to be more general and binding since the 1990s, giving the STF increasing policy-making authority (Desposato et al. 2015). The STF is also generally regarded as a very visible high court, due in large part to the media attention it has drawn in deciding major issues of national importance, including racial quotas and affirmative action, family status for same-sex couples, stem-cell research, land invasions, pension and tax reform, and political corruption (Taylor 2008; Kapiszewski 2012; Falc{\~a}o and de Oliveira 2013; Desposato et al. 2015). However, with few exceptions (e.g., Falc{\~a}o and de Oliveira 2013), an underexamined feature of the court is its unusually high transparency. Indeed, compared with its regional peers, and even with the US Supreme Court, the Brazilian STF can reasonably be called the most transparent high, constitutional court in the Americas.This chapter offers three main contributions: (1) a descriptive documentation of this high transparency, (2) an examination of some of the sources of this transparency, including media relations, and (3) an examination of some of the implications of this transparency, especially regarding public opinion of the court. In documenting the STF's uncommon transparency, I draw on existing data on the openness of national courts across Latin America, specifically, a study of the web-based access to judicial information conducted by the Center for Judicial Studies of the Americas (Centro de Estudios Judiciales de las Americas, CEJA (N.d.)), which is an organ of the Organization of American States (OAS). In examining the sources of this transparency, I build on recent scholarship on the rising media coverage of the STF (Falc{\~a}o and de Oliveira 2013), and also on the STF's data and documents on its own public relations operations and internal, intrainstitutional efforts to generate media coverage of itself.},

 abstract = {Judicial independence is an idea that has both internal (or normative) and external (or institutional) aspects. From a normative viewpoint, judges should be autonomous moral agents, who can be relied on to carry out their public duties independent of venal or ideological considerations. Independence, or impartiality, in this sense is a desirable aspect of a judge's character. But judges are human, and the things they must decide can matter greatly to people. Therefore, we are also concerned with providing institutional shields against the threats or temptations that might come their way. Judicial independence, in this sense, is a feature of the institutional setting within which judging takes place. Institutional judicial independence is, however, a complex value in that it really cannot be seen as something valuable in itself. Rather, it is instrumental to the pursuit of other values, such as the rule of law or constitutional values.},

Courts are reason-giving institutions, with argumentation playing a central role in constitutional adjudication. However, a cursory look at just a handful of constitutional systems suggests important differences in the practices of constitutional judges, whether in matters of form, style, or language. Focusing on independently-verified leading cases globally, a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis offers the most comprehensive and systematic account of constitutional reasoning to date. This analysis is supported by the examination of eighteen legal systems around the world including the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. Universally common aspects of constitutional reasoning are identified in this book, and contributors also examine whether common law countries differ to civil law countries in this respect},

Reviewing more than 100 recent articles and working papers, this research note argues that inattention to the measurement of backsliding and the underlying concept of democracy drives this disagreement. We propose three remedies. First, we outline several questions that help researchers navigate common measurement challenges. Second, we argue that conceptual confusion around backsliding is driven in large part by inconsistent definitions of democracy. We show how outlining a comprehensive concept of democracy enables researchers to better account for the diversity of instances of democratic backsliding. Our third contribution is drawing attention to a previously overlooked form of backsliding: when governments lose the effective power to govern or voters and elites increasingly disagree about truths and facts. The research note urges scholars to pay closer attention to the conceptualization and measurement of backsliding prior to empirical analysis.},

@article{Kapiszewski.2011,
 abstract = {[This article advances a new account of judicial behavior: the thesis of tactical balancing. Building on existing models of judicial decision making, the thesis posits that high court justices balance a discrete set of considerations---justices' ideologies, their institutional interests, the potential consequences of their rulings, public opinion, elected leaders' preferences, and law---as they decide important cases. Variation in a high court's balancing of those considerations as it decides different cases leads it to alternate between challenging and endorsing the exercise of government power. The way in which high courts carry out this {\textquotedbl}tactical balancing{\textquotedbl} reflects their broader strategy for prioritizing the different roles they can play in a polity, and thus has significant implications for the rule of law and regime stability in developing democracies. The thesis is illustrated through a detailed analysis of the Brazilian high court's rulings on cases concerning crucial economic policies (1985--2004).]},

This paper introduces a la carte embedding, a simple and general alternative to the usual word2vec-based approaches for building such representations that is based upon recent theoretical results for GloVe-like embeddings. Our method relies mainly on a linear transformation that is efficiently learnable using pretrained word vectors and linear regression. This transform is applicable on the fly in the future when a new text feature or rare word is encountered, even if only a single usage example is available. We introduce a new dataset showing how the a la carte method requires fewer examples of words in context to learn high-quality embeddings and we obtain state-of-the-art results on a nonce task and some unsupervised document classification tasks.},

While there exists a consensus that populism is incompatible with core tenets of liberal democracy on a conceptual level, we know much less about whether or not the participation of populist parties in government constitutes a threat to liberal democracy in practice. We study the impact of populist parties in coalition governments using a novel data set of more than 2000 laws that were under review at the Austrian Constitutional Court between 1980 and 2021. We provide evidence that the court did not find laws passed by governments that included a populist party unconstitutional more often than those passed by non-populist governments. Our findings indicate that the Austrian Freedom Party did moderate its policy while in office. The results imply that it is necessary to distinguish policy positions in party manifestos and party rhetoric from policies actually implemented by~governments.

We do so using a two-step regression approach that allows us to investigate the varying effect of external efficacy in a multilevel setting. Making use of data on 23 European Union member states, we empirically demonstrate that the nature of support for populists varies depending on the extent to which these parties are established actors in their national party systems. This is true for Western and Eastern European populist parties. These findings make an important contribution to the broader literature on the success and survival of populist parties. They indicate that these parties do not keep up their image as radical opponents of the national political establishment the more they become electorally successful and join government coalitions.},

@article{Krehbiel.2016,
 abstract = {Modern liberal democracies typically depend on courts with the power of constitutional review to ensure that elected officials do not breach their constitutional obligations. The efficacy of this review, however, can depend on the public observing such breaches. One resource available to many of the world's constitutional courts to influence the public's ability to do so is public oral hearings. Drawing on the comparative judicial literature on separation of powers, public awareness, and noncompliance, I develop a formal model of public oral hearings. The model provides empirical implications for when a court will hold public oral hearings and how hearings correspond to a court's willingness to rule against elected officials. An empirical analysis of hearings at the German Constitutional Court supports the model's prediction that courts use hearings as a resource to address potential noncompliance.},

 abstract = {Understanding how high courts successfully constrain the state poses a puzzle central to the study of constitutional review. An increasingly popular answer to this puzzle is that voters electorally punish governments for noncompliance with judicial decisions. This article conducts a crossnational analysis of the relationship between noncompliance and an incumbent government's electoral success. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on noncompliance with the national high courts of 74 countries from 2007 to 2017, I examine whether voters systematically punish or reward noncompliance. The analysis of a series of hierarchical linear models reveals that engaging in more noncompliance decreases an incumbent government's vote share in contexts with a strong pre-existing norm of compliance. This result is robust to both the inclusion of potential confounding variables and alternative model specifications.},

 abstract = {The concept of issue salience has figured prominently in many studies of American political life. Long lines of research have taught us that both citizens and political elites may respond differently to issues that are salient to them than to those that are not. Yet analysts making such claims about elite actors face a fundamental problem that their counterparts in mass behavior do not: they cannot survey, say, members of the Supreme Court to ascertain those cases that are especially salient to the justices. Rather, scholars must rely on surrogates for issue salience-surrogates that are fraught with problems and that have led to disparate research results. Accordingly, we offer an alternative approach to measure issue salience for elite actors: the coverage the media affords to a given issue. We argue that this approach has substantial benefits over those employed in the past. Most notably, it provides a reproducible, valid, and transportable method of assessing whether the particular actors under investigation view an issue as salient or not. In making the case for our measure we focus on Supreme Court justices but we are sanguine about its applicability to other political actors},

@book{LaTorre.2019,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}This volume illustrates the diversity of populism globally. When seeking power, populists politicize issues, and point to problems that need to be addressed such as inequalities, the loss of national sovereignty to globalization, or the rule of unresponsive political elites. Yet their solutions tend to be problematic, simplistic, and in most instances, instead of leading to better forms of democracy their outcomes are authoritarianism. Populists use a playbook of concentrating power in the hands of the president, using the legal system instrumentally to punish critics, and attacking the media and civil society. Despite promising to empower the people, populists lead to processes of democratic erosion and even transform malfunctioning democracies into hybrid regimes. The Routledge Handbook of Global Populism provides instructors, students, and researchers with a thorough and systematic overview of the history and development of populism and analyses the main debates. It is divided into sections on the theories of populism, on political and social theory and populism, on how populists politicize inequalities and differences, on the media and populism, on its ambiguous relationships with democratization and authoritarianism, and on the distinct regional manifestations of populism. Leading international academics from history, political science, media studies, anthropology, and sociology map innovative ideas and areas of theoretical and empirical research to understand the phenomena of global populism{\textquotedbl}...},

@article{LaTorre.2020,
 abstract = {The article explores the effects of populist polarization in creating strong and long-lasting institutions based on the rule of law. It focuses on politics and not on the political economy of populism or of natural resource extraction. The first section briefly explains how we understand the contested notions of populism and the rule of law. The second focuses on the paradigmatic case of Juan Per{\'o}n's first two administrations (1946-1956) to explore the ambiguous legacies of populist inclusion for the creation of long-lasting demo-cratic institutions. The third section focuses on how Hugo Ch{\'a}vez, Evo Morales and Rafael Correa appealed to the un-bounded will of the people to convene participatory constituent assemblies. The last section focuses on Ecuador's post-populist succession. Different from Evo Morales that was ousted by a coup, or Nicol{\'a}s Maduro that killed democracy, Len{\'i}n Moreno, who was Correa's former vice-president, abandoned populism, ditched his mentor, and used a referendum to clean the state and political institutions from Correa's allies. Appealing to the people directly, his administration assumed exceptional powers to name new authorities of control and accountability. His institutional reforms however might not last because they were based on the exclusion of Correa and his followers. The conclusion explores the reasons why actors continue to use laws instrumentally making it difficult to create long-lasting institutional arrangements based on the rule of law, and hence on the possibility of deepening democracy.},

@article{Lee.1999,
 abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

@article{Levitsky.2013,
 abstract = {Although military rule disappeared in Latin America after 1990, other forms of authoritarianism persisted. Competitive authoritarianism, in which democratic institutions exist but incumbent abuse skews the playing field against opponents, emerged in Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador during the post-Cold War period. This article seeks to explain the emergence of competitive authoritarianism in the Andes. It argues that populism ? the election of a personalistic outsider who mobilizes voters with an anti-establishment appeal ? is a major catalyst for the emergence of competitive authoritarianism. Lacking experience with representative democratic institutions, possessing an electoral mandate to destroy the existing elite, and facing institutions of horizontal accountability controlled by that elite, populists have an incentive to launch plebiscitary attacks on institutions of horizontal accountability. Where they succeed, weak democracies almost invariably slide into competitive authoritarianism. The argument is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of all 14 elected presidents in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela between 1990 and 2010.},

 abstract = {Donald Trump's presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought we'd be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang---in a revolution or military coup---but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.



Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die---and how ours can be saved.},

Scholars have demonstrated that judicial elections provide a clear link between public opinion and judicial decision making that may undermine the ability of courts to act in counter-majoritarian ways to protect minority rights. We extend this line of inquiry by examining whether direct democracy institutions have a similar effect of enhancing the impact of public opinion on judicial behavior and reducing the likelihood of judges voting in favor of minority rights. Empirical results from an analysis of gay rights cases in the American states from 1981 to 2004 provide evidence that direct democracy, in conjunction with electoral retention methods, significantly increases the effect of public opinion on judicial decisions.]},

In addition, the noticeability of the effects of globalization in everyday life and relating uncertainties have contributed to feelings shared by an increasing number of voters that traditional parties are no longer able to solve today's political, economic and social problems. Thus, people tend to support populist alternatives. The chapter focuses on the example of Austria, where the center right Sebastian Kurz List---the New People's Party has accepted the far right-wing populist Austrian Freedom Party as junior coalition partner in December 2017. The former has itself recently turned into an in-between center right party and right-wing populist movement under the leadership of the party's chairman and until May 2019 Austrian federal chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Due to political developments in Austria throughout the last two decades which eventually culminated in the result of the 2017 general elections and the following formation of the coalition government between the People's Party and the Freedom Party, Austria can serve as a prime example for the analysis of a changed frame of political discourse which further supports the process of normalization of right-wing populism.},

 abstract = {[In most major democracies there are very few parties compared to the number of possible policy positions held by voters. We provide an efficiency rationale for why it might be appropriate to limit the proliferation of parties. In our model, the larger the number of parties, the greater the inefficiency of the outcome of electoral competition. The reason is that, when the number of parties increases, electoral incentives push each party to focus its electoral promises on a narrower constituency, and then special interest policies replace more efficient policies that have diffuse benefits. The analysis provides a possible explanation for the existence of institutional features that limit the extent of electoral competition: thresholds of exclusion, runoff electoral systems, and majoritarian two-party political systems.]},

 abstract = {ABSTRACTLess than 30 years after Fukuyama and others declared liberal democracy?s eternal dominance, a third wave of autocratization is manifest. Gradual declines of democratic regime attributes characterize contemporary autocratization. Yet, we lack the appropriate conceptual and empirical tools to diagnose and compare such elusive processes. Addressing that gap, this article provides the first comprehensive empirical overview of all autocratization episodes from 1900 to today based on data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem). We demonstrate that a third wave of autocratization is indeed unfolding. It mainly affects democracies with gradual setbacks under a legal fa{\c{c}}ade. While this is a cause for concern, the historical perspective presented in this article shows that panic is not warranted: the current declines are relatively mild and the global share of democratic countries remains close to its all-time high. As it was premature to announce the ?end of history? in 1992, it is premature to proclaim the ?end of democracy? now.},

I shall attempt to link the theoretical premises underlying one important aspect of constitutional design, the amendment process, with the empirical patterns revealed by a systematic, comparative study of constitutions. An examination of all amendments in the 50 American states since 1776 reveals patterns that are then confirmed using data from 32 national constitutions. The interaction of the two key variables affecting amendment rate can be described by an equation that generates predicted amendment rates close to those found in the cross-national empirical analysis. A constitution's length measured in number of words, the difficulty of an amendment process, and the rate of amendment turn out to have interlocking consequences that illuminate principles of constitutional design.]},

This article provides a systematic analysis of the direct and indirect effects of radical right anti-immigration parties on migration policy reforms in 17 West European countries from 1990 to 2014. Insights from migration policy theory serve to explain variations in the migration policy success of the radical right. While previous studies mostly treat migration policy as uniform, it is argued that this approach neglects the distinct political logics of immigration and integration policy. This article reveals significant variations in policy success by policy area. While immigration policies have become more liberal despite the electoral success of the radical right, when the radical right is in government office it enacts more restrictions in integration policies. Accordingly, anti-immigrant mobilisation is more likely to influence immigrants? rights than their actual numbers.},

@article{Markowski.2019,
 abstract = {Since the 2015 elections, Poland has `enjoyed' the attention of social sciences---political science in particular---to an extent greater than at any time since the period of ``Solidarity'' in the early 1980s. In contrast to that period, Poland's idiosyncratic development over the last two and a half years can hardly be said to play the function of a normative role model. Political developments in Poland in recent times devolve into two stories: one of profound civilizational, economic and social development prior to the 2015 elections; the other of an unexpected and sudden shift toward the dismantling of the liberal democratic system after the Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in late 2015. The first part of this article describes the most important features of pre-2015 political developments in Poland and identifies key determinants of vote choice in the 2015 parliamentary election in Poland. In brief, this analysis shows two things: that there was no `demand' for systemic change at these elections, and that support for the winning party was mainly determined by socio-cultural factors rather than economic ones. The second part of the article aims to answer the question of why the PiS government has embarked on a course of political action that violates both the abstract principles of liberal democracy and concrete, binding provisions of Poland's 1997 Constitution. Several theoretical and speculative ideas are offered in answer to this question.},

@article{Meltzer.1981,
 abstract = {In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is determined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincentive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity.

@article{Meyer.2020,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT Research on the media coverage of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court has revealed that the newsworthiness of a court decision ? as determined by specific case characteristics ? influences the likelihood that the decision will be covered by the media. However, in the context of European constitutional courts, media coverage of court decisions can be understood to be a form of justice reporting that focuses on general public interest and is operationalized by case characteristics that indicate the newsworthiness of the decisions. Using the case of the German Federal Constitutional Court, the determining factors behind whether court decisions are featured in the German media (i.e., that they receive media coverage in at least one newspaper article) are expounded. A local text alignment measurement of court decisions and newspaper articles enables media coverage to be identified based on original data on 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles from between 2008 and 2018. The results demonstrate that media coverage of the German Court is not affected by declarations of unconstitutionality, though coverage is more likely when a decision is accompanied by a press release, an oral hearing, a dissenting opinion, or a combination of all three items. As these decisional aspects are the prerogative of the FCC, the results demonstrate that the German Constitutional Court has the necessary instruments to independently influence media coverage.},

Although several courts regularly publish press releases on decisions, it is unclear which policy issues are more likely to be promoted by courts. This study argues that courts publish press releases to increase transparency and promote politically contested issues strategically. Using original data on the German Federal Constitutional Court, it assesses the role of press releases for judicial agenda-setting. Policy issues in 7114 court decisions between 1998 and 2019 were coded through supervised text classification. The results show that the press releases cover a greater range of policy issues than the Court's decisions. They are more likely to be published for decisions that deal with politically contested issues.

This article uses a different angle by focusing on public policy impact and the role these parties play in the parliamentary and executive arenas. The research is driven by the hypothesis that under the conditions of stable democracy, holding office produces a net result in a ?taming effect? on radical right?wing actors rather than a sharp ?right turn?. Evidence f rom four countries (Germany, France, Italy and Austria) shows that parliamentary presence alone does not result in policy effects. When the radical right holds executive office, a ?right turn? occurs primarily in cultural policies. Overall, real effects of radical right?wing politics occur largely as a result of the interaction between the radical right and established actors ?regardless of the radical right's assuming power.},

{\textquotedbl}Though the extreme right was not particularly successful in the 1999 European elections, it continues to be a major factor in the politics of Western Europe. This book, newly available in paperback, provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the extreme right in the Netherlands (Centrumdemocraten, Centrumpartij'86), Belgium (Vlaams Blok) and Germany (Die Republikaner, Deutsche Volksunion). On the basis of original research - using party literature - the author concludes that though individual parties might stress different issues, the extreme right party family does share a core ideology of nationalism, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism, and law and order. The author's research and conclusions clearly have broader implications for the study of the extreme right phenomenon and party ideology in general, and the book should be of interest to anyone studying or researching in the areas of European politics, political ideologies, political parties, extremism, racism or nationalism{\textquotedbl}--Publisher's description},

@book{Mudde.2017b,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Populism is a central concept in the current media debates about politics and elections. However, like most political buzzwords, the term often floats from one meaning to another, and both social scientists and journalists use it to denote diverse phenomena. What is populism really? Who are the populist leaders? And what is the relationship between populism and democracy? This book answers these questions in a simple and persuasive way, offering a swift guide to populism in theory and practice.  Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovera Kaltwasser present populism as an ideology that divides society into two antagonistic camps, the {\textquotedbl}pure people{\textquotedbl} versus the {\textquotedbl}corrupt elite,{\textquotedbl} and that privileges the general will of the people above all else. They illustrate the practical power of this ideology through a survey of representative populist movements of the modern era: European right-wing parties, left-wing presidents in Latin America, and the Tea Party movement in the United States. The authors delve into the ambivalent personalities of charismatic populist leaders such as Juan Domingo Péron, H. Ross Perot, Jean-Marie le Pen, Silvio Berlusconi, and Hugo Chávez. If the strong male leader embodies the mainstream form of populism, many resolute women, such as Eva Péron, Pauline Hanson, and Sarah Palin, have also succeeded in building a populist status, often by exploiting gendered notions of society.  Although populism is ultimately part of democracy, populist movements constitute an increasing challenge to democratic politics. Comparing political trends across different countries, this compelling book debates what the long-term consequences of this challenge could be, as it turns the spotlight on the bewildering effect of populism on today's political and social life. {\textquotedbl}

{\textquotedbl}Populism is central to current debates about politics, from radical right parties in Europe to left-wing presidents in Latin America to the Tea Party in the United States. But populism is also one of the most contested concepts in the social sciences. This book offers a timely and wide-ranging guide to understanding populism both in theory and practice, highlighting its relevance for the contemporary political debate{\textquotedbl}--},

@article{Mullinix.2016,
 abstract = {An enduring and increasingly acute concern---in an age of polarized parties---is that people's partisan attachments distort preference formation at the expense of relevant information. For example, research suggests that a Democrat may support a policy proposed by Democrats, but oppose the same policy if proposed by Republicans. However, a related body of literature suggests that how people respond to information and form preferences is distorted by their prior issue attitudes. In neither instance is information even-handedly evaluated, rather, it is interpreted in light of partisanship or existing issue opinions. Both effects are well documented in isolation, but in most political scenarios individuals consider both partisanship and prior opinions---yet, these dynamics may or may not pull toward the same preference. Using nationally representative experiments focused on tax and education policies, I introduce and test a theory that isolates when: partisanship dominates preference formation, partisanship and issue opinions reinforce or offset each other, and issue attitudes trump partisanship. The findings make clear that the public does not blindly follow party elites. Depending on elite positions, the level of partisan polarization, and personal importance of issues, the public can be attentive to information and shirk the influence of party elites. The results have broad implications for political parties and citizen competence in contemporary democratic politics.},

However, they are based on the assumption that latent positions can be captured just by modeling word-frequency information from the different documents under study. We challenge this by presenting a new semantically aware unsupervised scaling algorithm, SemScale, which relies upon distributional representations of the documents under study. We conduct an extensive quantitative analysis over a collection of speeches from the European Parliament in five different languages and from two different legislations, in order to understand whether a) an approach that is aware of semantics would better capture known underlying political dimensions compared to a frequency-based scaling method, b) such positioning correlates in particular with a specific subset of linguistic traits, compared to the use of the entire text, and c) these findings hold across different languages. To support further research on this new branch of text scaling approaches, we release the employed dataset and evaluation setting, an easy-to-use online demo, and a Python implementation of SemScale.},

 abstract = {[Does public policy respond to public opinion? Previous research suggests dynamic representation occurs in the aggregate. Yet, most of the evidence for policy response is limited to the policy intentions of elected officials on issues related to more or less government spending. We examine policy response to an alternative dimension of public mood, public preferences for more or less punitive criminal justice policies, using multiple indicators of policy from various stages of the policy-making process. Criminal justice policy should be responsive to public preferences given the public's concern about crime and the negative social construction of criminals. Thus, there is an electoral incentive for public officials to respond to public preferences along this alternative dimension of public sentiment regarding criminal justice policy. We estimate a DYMIMIC model of federal criminal justice policy as a function of the multiple dimensions of public policy mood using Kaiman filtering. The results indicate that criminal justice policy responds to the second, not the first, dimension of public mood. We find evidence that policy-makers at multiple stages of the policy process are able to differentiate among multiple signals from the public and respond appropriately. The results present a more sophisticated portrait of democratic responsiveness.]},

Many fear that democracies are suffering from a legitimacy crisis. This book focuses on 'democratic deficits', reflecting how far the perceived democratic performance of any state diverges from public expectations. Pippa Norris examines the symptoms by comparing system support in more than fifty societies worldwide, challenging the pervasive claim that most established democracies have experienced a steadily rising tide of political disaffection during the third-wave era. The book diagnoses the reasons behind the democratic deficit, including demand (rising public aspirations for democracy), information (negative news about government) and supply (the performance and structure of democratic regimes). Finally, Norris examines the consequences for active citizenship, for governance and, ultimately, for democratization. This book provides fresh insights into major issues at the heart of comparative politics, public opinion, political culture, political behavior, democratic governance, political psychology, political communications, public policymaking, comparative sociology, cross-national survey analysis and the dynamics of the democratization process},

@article{Osborne.2012,
 abstract = {Logistic regression is slowly gaining acceptance in the social sciences, and fills an important niche in the researcher{\^a}{\text\euro}{\texttrademark}s toolkit: being able to predict important outcomes that are not continuous in nature. While OLS regression is a valuable tool, it cannot routinely be used to predict outcomes that are binary or categorical in nature. These outcomes represent important social science lines of research: retention in, or dropout from school, using illicit drugs, underage alcohol consumption, antisocial behavior, purchasing decisions, voting patterns, risky behavior, and so on. The goal of this paper is to briefly lead the reader through the surprisingly simple mathematics that underpins logistic regression: probabilities, odds, odds ratios, and logits. Anyone with spreadsheet software or a scientific calculator can follow along, and in turn, this knowledge can be used to make much more interesting, clear, and accurate presentations of results (especially to non-technical audiences). In particular, I will share an example of an interaction in logistic regression, how it was originally graphed, and how the graph was made substantially more user-friendly by converting the original metric (logits) to a more readily interpretable metric (probability) through three simple steps.

Diese Verbindung aus Erfolg auf nationaler und Isolierung auf europ{\"a}ischer Ebene h{\"a}ngt mit dem spezifischen Charakter der FP{\"O} zusammen: Sie ist 'populistisch' - weil sie beansprucht, 'das Volk' gegen die Eliten zu vertreten und zu mobilisieren. Sie ist 'rechtspopulistisch' - weil sie, wie andere Parteien in Europa (FN, Lega Nord, Vlaams Blok, etc.) auch, sich zur Verteidigung von (nationaler oder ethnischer) Identit{\"a}t gegen die Aufhebung oder verst{\"a}rkte Durchl{\"a}ssigkeit von Grenzen wendet. Sie ist aber auch, im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen rechtspopulistischen Parteien Europas, eine Traditionspartei - und Teil dieser Tradition ist auch die {\"o}sterreichische NSDAP. Erst die Kombination aller Faktoren erkl{\"a}rt den Erfolg der FP{\"O} - aber auch die internationale Reaktion auf diesen Erfolg.' (Autorenreferat)},

@article{Peruzzotti.2017,
 abstract = {The global ascendancy that populism has gained in recent years resulted in two major developments: (a) the geographical spread of populism to an increasing number of countries, to the extent that in regions such as the Americas and Europe populism appears as the main contender of mainstream politics; (b) populism shifting from the margins to the center stage of politics, a development that resulted in the passage of populism as a movement to populism as government. A central hypothesis guiding this article is that populism in government is likely to promote a specific path to regime change: one consisting of the gradual hybridization of the structure of liberal democracy through the selective removal of some of the latter's defining features. The contemporary proliferation of populist administrations in Europe and the Americas should consequently not be taken lightly: they might be announcing political processes that can ultimately result in a drastic redefinition of the landscape of current democratic politics in an illiberal direction.},

Then, it analyzes the role that the ideals of progress and equality have played in the judicialization of pan-European legal culture.

The essay argues that the effort to insulate judges from significant economic incentives, through devices such as life tenure and stringent conflict of interest rules, has not rendered judicial behavior immune to economic analysis. Drawing on analogies to the managers of non-profit enterprises, to those who vote in political elections, and to theatrical spectators, the essay models the judicial utility function in terms that allows judges to be seen as ordinary people responding rationally to ordinary incentives. This model provides a theoretical alternative to the common view of judges as Prometheans or saints, and it suggests new ways of looking at such practical issues as the design of the judicial compensation system.},

The Judge as Political Theorist examines opinions by constitutional courts in liberal democracies to better understand the logic and nature of constitutional review. David Robertson argues that the constitutional judge's role is nothing like that of the legislator or chief executive, or even the ordinary judge. Rather, constitutional judges spell out to society the implications--on the ground--of the moral and practical commitments embodied in the nation's constitution. Constitutional review, in other words, is a form of applied political theory. Robertson takes an in-depth look at constitutio},

 abstract = {ABSTRACTBy the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century, populists have taken charge in Turkey, India and Israel, all previously heralded as exceptional democracies in difficult regions. This moment offers a unique opportunity to explore populism in power outside Europe and the Americas, in three states shaped by deep social, ethnic and religious divisions. This article locates Turkey, India and Israel within a global wave of electorally successful populist movements. It explores how populism can jeopardize democratic choice in deeply divided societies and whether Erdo?an?s capture of democracy in Turkey offers a blueprint for the political strategies employed by Modi and Netanyahu. In unravelling parallels between the three administrations, our analysis uncovers a common populist playbook of neoliberal economic policies, the leveraging of ethnoreligious tensions as well as attempts to denigrate independent news media, by portraying it as the ?enemy of the people?. Although their position on the spectrum between democracy and authoritarianism differs, our analysis reveals striking continuities in the erosion of democracy in Turkey, India and Israel as a result of these policies, thus highlighting the vulnerability of political systems, particularly those of deeply divided societies, to democratic decay.},

@article{Rogers.2001,
 abstract = {[This article develops a simple signaling game in which a Legislature and a Court interact in seeking their own policy goals. The Legislature faces two sources of uncertainty when legislating. First, it knows only probabilistically whether the Court's preferences converge or diverge from its own on the proposed law. Second, its knows only probabilistically the true state of the world and, hence, does not know with certainty whether the law will reasonably achieve its intended outcome if enacted. For institutional and sequential reasons, the Court has more information regarding the actual consequences of an enacted law than the Legislature did when initially considering it. As a result, the Court's exercise of the judicial veto may (but not necessarily will) be informationally productive. The possibility of informative judicial review affects the quantity and informational quality of legislation enacted by the Legislature relative to legislation that would be enacted in the absence of judicial review. Further, an informational component to judicial review alters the incentive that the Court has to act strategically relative to incentives for strategic behavior in purely distributive models of legislative-judicial interaction. Finally, because of the possibility of informative judicial review, the model accounts endogenously for the creation and maintenance of an independent judiciary by a Legislature that solely values achieving its preferred policy outcomes.]},

Populist forces are becoming increasingly relevant across the world, and studies on populism have entered the mainstream of the political science discipline. However, so far no book has synthesized the ongoing debate on how to study the populist phenomenon. This handbook provides state of the art research and scholarship on populism, and lays out, not only the cumulated knowledge on populism, but also the ongoing discussions and research gaps on this topic. The Oxford Handbook of Populism is divided into four sections. The first presents the main conceptual approaches on populism and points out how the phenomenon in question can be empirically analyzed. The second focuses on populist forces across the world and includes chapters on Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, India, Latin America, the Post-Soviet States, the United States, and Western Europe. The third reflects on the interaction between populism and various relevant issues both from a scholarly and political point of view. Amongst other issues, chapters analyze the relationship between populism and fascism, foreign policy, gender, nationalism, political parties, religion, social movements and technocracy. Finally, the fourth part includes some of the most recent normative debates on populism, including chapters on populism and cosmopolitanism, constitutionalism, hegemony, the history of popular sovereignty, the idea of the people, and socialism. The handbook features contributions from leading experts in the field, and is indispensable, positioning the study of populism in political science},

 abstract = {Main description: Dieses Buch f{\"u}hrt ein in die grundlegenden Ans{\"a}tze des Clusterns, Segmentierens und der Faktorextraktion. -- Kapitel 1 f{\"u}hrt ein in die Clusteranalyse. Nach einem intuitiven Beispiel anhand des Clusterns von Muscheln am Strand, und dem zugrundeliegenden, oft unausgesprochenen Cluster-Prinzipien werden u.a. die hierarchische, partitionierende und das TwoStep-Verfahren vorgestellt. Bei der hierarchischen Clusteranalyse (CLUSTER) werden die diversen Ma{\ss}e (z.B. quadrierte euklidische Distanz, Pearson-Korrelation, Chi$^2$-Ma{\ss} etc.) und die jeweiligen Algorithmen (Density, Linkage, Ward etc.) einschl. ihrer Bias (z.B. Ausrei{\ss}er, Chaining) erl{\"a}utert. Anhand zahlreicher Beispiele wird erl{\"a}utert, wie Intervalldaten, H{\"a}ufigkeiten, Kategorialdaten, sowie gemischte Daten geclustert werden. Bei der partitionierenden Clusterzentrenanalyse (k-means, QUICK CLUSTER) lernen Sie Teststatistiken zur Bestimmung der optimalen Clusterzahl kennen (z.B. Eta$^2$, F-max; nicht im original SPSS Leistungsumfang enthalten), sowie die ausgew{\"a}hlte Clusterl{\"o}sung auf Interpretierbarkeit, Stabilit{\"a}t und Validit{\"a}t zu pr{\"u}fen. Bei der Two-Step Clusteranalyse (TWOSTEP CLUSTER) lernen Sie die Clusterung von gemischten Daten anhand eines Scoring-Algorithmus kennen Dar{\"u}ber hinaus lernen Sie Kriterien f{\"u}r die Beurteilung einer guten Clusterl{\"o}sung kennen, wie auch alternative grafische und logische Ans{\"a}tze zur Clusterung von auch Daten im String-Format. -- Kapitel 2 f{\"u}hrt ein in die Gruppe der Faktorenanalyse mit SPSS. Die Faktorenanalyse (factor analysis, FA) ist ein Sammelbegriff f{\"u}r verschiedene Verfahren, die es erm{\"o}glichen, aus einer gro{\ss}en Zahl von Variablen eine m{\"o}glichst geringe Anzahl von (nicht beobachteten) 'Faktoren' zu erhalten ('extrahieren'). Die Faktorenanalyse geht nicht von unabh{\"a}ngigen oder abh{\"a}ngigen Variablen aus, sondern behandelt alle Analysevariablen unabh{\"a}ngig von einem Kausalit{\"a}tsstatus. Dieser Kurs f{\"u}hrt in das Grundprinzip und Varianten der Faktorenanalyse (z.B. Alpha, Hauptfaktoren, Hauptkomponenten), die wichtigsten Extraktions-, wie auch Rotationsmethoden (z.B. orthogonal vs. oblique) und ihre Funktion. Vorgestellt werden Kriterien zur Bestimmung, Interpretation und Benennung der Faktoren. Dieser Kurs stellt ausschlie{\ss}lich die Variante der explorativen Faktorenanalyse (EFA) vor (R-Typ). Abschliessend werden eine Faktorenanalyse f{\"u}r F{\"a}lle (Q-Typ Faktorenanalyse vorgestellt, sowie eine Matrix-Variante, die dann zum Einsatz kommen kann, wenn die korrelationsanalytischen Voraussetzungen der Faktorenanalyse nicht erf{\"u}llt sind. Die {\"U}berpr{\"u}fung der Voraussetzungen und die Interpretation der Statistiken werden an zahlreichen Beispielen ge{\"u}bt. -- Kapitel 3 stellt die Diskriminanzanalyse (DA, syn.: DFA, Diskriminanzfunktionsanalyse) vor. Das zentrale Ziel dieses Ansatzes ist, die beste Trennung (Diskriminanz) zwischen den Zugeh{\"o}rigkeiten einer abh{\"a}ngigen Gruppenvariable f{\"u}r mehrere unabh{\"a}ngige Einflussvariablen zu finden. In anderen Worten, die Diskriminanzanalyse liefert die Antwort auf die Frage: Welche Kombination von Einflussvariablen erlaubt eine maximal trennende Aufteilung der F{\"a}lle in die bekannten Auspr{\"a}gungen einer Gruppe? Weitere, damit in Zusammenhang stehende Fragen k{\"o}nnen sein: Auf welche Weise werden die F{\"a}lle klassiert, wie genau werden die F{\"a}lle klassiert (erkennbar an der Anzahl der Fehlklassifikationen), und wie sind die schlussendlich entstehenden Klassifizierungen zu interpretieren? Es werden u.a. diverse Methoden der Variablenselektion (direkt, schrittweise), sowie auch die Berechnung und Interpretation multipler schrittweiser Diskriminanzanalysen mit mehreren ermittelten Funktionen vorgestellt (einschliesslich Lambda, Box-Test, Kreuzvalidierung (Interpretation von Kovarianz-Matrizen), das Identifizieren von Multikollinearit{\"a}t, sowie Gebietskarten (Territorien). -- Weitere Kapitel stellen M{\"o}glichkeiten des Clusterns und Segmentierens (u.a. mit CLEMENTINE, Entscheidungsb{\"a}ume und ausgew{\"a}hlte Cluster-Knoten. In einem abschlie{\ss}enden Kapitel sind ausgew{\"a}hlte Formeln der wichtigsten behandelten Verfahren zusammengestellt. -- Zahlreiche Rechenbeispiele werden von der Fragestellung, der Anforderung der einzelnen Statistiken (per Maus, per Syntax) bis hin zur Interpretation der SPSS- und CLEMENTINE Ausgaben systematisch durchgespielt. Auch auf m{\"o}gliche Fallstricke und h{\"a}ufig begangene Fehler wird eingegangen. Separate Abschnitte stellen die diversen Voraussetzungen f{\"u}r die Durchf{\"u}hrung der jeweiligen Analyse, sowie Ans{\"a}tze zu ihrer {\"U}berpr{\"u}fung zusammen. Dieses Buch ist angenehm verst{\"a}ndlich und anwendungsorientiert geschrieben, ohne jedoch die Komplexit{\"a}t und damit erforderliche Tiefe bei der Vorstellung der Verfahren zu vernachl{\"a}ssigen. Dieses Buch ist f{\"u}r Einsteiger, Studierende, sowie fortgeschrittene Wissenschaftler in den Wirtschafts-, Bio-, und Sozialwissenschaften gleicherma{\ss}en geeignet.

 abstract = {[Buried within the general phenomenon of democratic decline is a set of cases in which charismatic new leaders are elected by democratic publics and then use their electoral mandates to dismantle by law the constitutional systems they inherited. These leaders aim to consolidate power and to remain in office indefinitely, eventually eliminating the ability of democratic publics to exercise their basic democratic rights, to hold leaders accountable, and to change their leaders peacefully. Because these {\textquotedbl}legalistic autocrats{\textquotedbl} deploy the law to achieve their aims, impending autocracy may not be evident at the start. But we can learn to spot the legalistic autocrats before autocratic constitutionalism becomes fatal because they are often following a script using tactics that they borrow from each other. This Essay explains the paths that these autocratic legalists take, the danger signals that accompany their legal reforms, and the methods they use to dismantle liberal constitutions. The Essay also suggests how the legalistic autocrats may be stopped.]},

@article{Scheppele.2019,
 abstract = {Liberal constitutionalism is under attack from a new breed ofautocrats broadly classified as populist. These populists understand the weaknesses ofconstitutional liberalism and attack their opponents with criticisms that take advantage of internal weaknesses of the theory. But a closer analysis of theoretical framework used by populists to substitute for constitutional liberalism reveals that they are not really committed to populism in any serious sense. Instead, they have abandoned liberalism in the quest for raw power. Focusing on Viktor Orb{\'a}n of Hungary and his chief ideologist Andr{\'a}s L{\'a}nczi, this article shows how their public critique of liberalism has attempted to wrong-foot their critics and how their recipe for gaining and wielding political power is only populist to the extent that these leaders are determined to (and often succeed in) winning elections. By peeling back the cover of populist ideology to look at the theories of legitimation under which they rule, however, we can see that the new breed of autocrats aims at primarily constitutional deconstruction through the concentration of political power in one leader. This sort of challenge to liberal constitutionalism is easily countered.},

@incollection{Scribner.2017,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTIONIn 2008 the Supreme Court of Argentina began implementing a judicial communication strategy. Crafted in the mid 2000s in response to low public support for and a lack of trust in the judiciary, the Supreme Court's communication strategy promises to create a more open and accessible judiciary. The Court's thinking: greater transparency, purposeful communication, and trained reporters would help the Court address its legitimacy and credibility deficits. Because the media plays a crucial intermediary role in shaping the public image of the court, media inattention, or worse misinterpretation or misrepresentation of judicial decisions, may serve to undermine judicial power and legitimacy. High courts have an institutional interest in making sure the press communicates the message justices want the public to understand about decisions and processes. Staton's (2010) work on the Mexican Supreme Court's use of strategic communication demonstrates how judges may construct their own power and legitimacy in part through a public relations strategy. Similarly, the Argentine Supreme Court has implemented a series of reforms aimed at increasing the court's transparency as well as a broader communication strategy with the explicit goal of improving the Supreme Court's legitimacy and public image and fortifying its authority vis-{\`a}-vis other political actors.This chapter describes the Court's communication and media strategy and asks whether these reforms have served to mitigate the Court's credibility gap with the public. The analysis is preliminary. The reforms have unfolded over multiple years and have been fully implemented only recently. Moreover, the Court and media have operated in a highly polarized political context that increasingly divided society between those who supported the Kirchner administrations (in power from 2003 to 2015) on the populist left and those who did not. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court's efforts to improve its credibility and begin to reconstruct its public legitimacy have succeeded among key social and political audiences, helping the Court to build stronger relationships with civil society organizations and the media and make important democratic allies (Litvachky and Zayat 2007, 126).},

 abstract = {[Objective. Prior research on the role of judge gender in voting behavior has led to competing theories about the impact of women judges. The purpose of this research is to determine whether female judges vote differently than their male colleagues. Methods. In an attempt to determine whether or not women judges are generally more willing to support the liberal position, this research examines the voting behavior of state supreme court judges from 1982 through 1993 in two substantive areas of law not generally identified as {\textquotedbl}women's issues{\textquotedbl}: obscenity and death penalty sentencing. The data include the universe of published obscenity decisions in that period and a random sample of death penalty decisions. The impact of judge gender is assessed through use of a logistic regression model. Results. Controlling for party and region, we find that women judges in state supreme courts tend to vote more liberally than their male counterparts in both death penalty and obscenity cases. Equally important, the presence of a woman on state supreme courts tends to increase the probability that male judges will also support the liberal position. Conclusions. The gender effects discovered do not appear to be an artifact of state ideology or the result of socialization patterns common to all women.]},

The findings are that there are significant gender differences on the courts of appeal that parallel those on the Supreme Court of Canada.

@article{Spierings.2017,
 abstract = {AbstractEmpirical studies have demonstrated that compared to almost all other parties, populist radical right (PRR) parties draw more votes from men than from women. However, the two dominant explanations that are generally advanced to explain this disparity ? gender differences regarding socio-economic position and lower perceptions regarding the threat of immigrants ? cannot fully explain the difference. The article contends that it might actually be gender differences regarding the conceptualisation of society and politics ? populist attitudes ? that explain the gender gap. Thus, the gap may be due, in part, to differences in socialisation. The article analyses EES 2014 data on voting for the populist radical right and the populist radical left in nine European countries. Across countries, the gender gap in voting for the PRR is indeed partly explained by populist attitudes. For populist radical left parties, the results are less clear, suggesting that populism has different meanings to voters on the left and on the right.},

In this article, I develop a simple game theory model that identifies how case promotion is linked to judicial choice.

Although they are not directly accountable to voters, constitutional court judges communicate with the general public through the media. In Judicial Power and Strategic Communication in Mexico, Jeffrey K. Staton argues that constitutional courts develop public relations strategies in order to increase the transparency of judicial behavior and promote judicial legitimacy. Yet, in some political contexts there can be a tension between transparency and legitimacy, and for this reason, courts cannot necessarily advance both conditions simultaneously. The argument is tested via an analysis of the Mexican Supreme Court during Mexico's recent transition to democracy, and also through a cross-national analysis of public perceptions of judicial legitimacy. The results demonstrate that judges can be active participants in the construction of their own power. More broadly, the study develops a positive political theory of institutions, which highlights the connections between democratization and the rule of law},

The data include detailed information on case and judge characteristics, cover a large number of cases, and involve a fairly sizable number of female and male judges. Besides their relevance for understanding judicial decision making and women in politics, the data are exceptionally well suited for addressing the recurrent social science inquiry into whether a policymaker's individual characteristics or organizational role has a greater influence on decision making as well as the current debate between {\textquotedbl}minimalist{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}maximalist{\textquotedbl} views of gender differences. Our results-based on additive and interactive models - indicate many similarities but some differences between women and men judges in their sentencing practices. Women judges are somewhat harsher (i.e., more likely to incarcerate and impose longer sentences), and they slant toward a more contextualized style in weighing the effects of defendant characteristics and prior record on sentencing outcomes.

Specifically, the public uses its ability to hold the elected branches of government accountable to enforce a judicial veto when judicial opposition to legislation provides more reliable information to voters than government support for legislation does. The model thus provides a theoretical justification for, and suggests important limits to, the common assumption that disregard for judicial decisions is politically costly for elected politicians.

Such opposition is ostensibly articulated most strongly by populist parties, which can be seen as the ultimate challengers to the (political) `elites'. By means of two often-identified cases of populism in the Netherlands (the radical right Freedom Party and left-wing Socialist Party), this study explores how populist party leaders use Twitter messages (tweets) to give form to their adversarial rhetoric in practice.

@article{Strother.2017,
 abstract = {Media coverage of Supreme Court decisions is not well-understood, with studies typically focusing on features of decisions such as issue area and opinion authorship, and ignoring the political and legal importance of those decisions. Because the Court is both secretive and esoteric, and because it does not engage in traditional public relations activities, media must proxy importance by looking to available cues, such as interest group participation. Importantly, some indicators of importance are available before a decision is rendered; thus I examine both pre- and post-decision media coverage of cases. I show that expected legal and political impact drive media coverage of Court decisions, and that the decision-level features that prior studies have focused on are much less important in determining coverage than has been previously thought.},

 abstract = {The project of European integration now spans Europe, but in becoming bigger and broader the European Union has brought on itself significant criticism. As the EU becomes deeper, wider, and more ambitious, so opposition and scepticism become more prominent for citizens and more problematic for elites. Concerns about a 'democratic deficit' and the distance between European elites and publics have come to be a common feature of European politics. As a consequence Euroscepticism has become a part of the terrain of conflict between political parties across Europe. Opposing Europe? provides the first comprehensive review of party-based Euroscepticism across the breadth of contemporary Europe and the first in-depth comparative academic study of Euroscepticism. This, the second of two volumes, is made up of comparative chapters which address different aspects of Euroscepticism. The volume looks across Europe and includes EU member states and candidate and non-member states in order to draw out comparative lessons that relate to the nature of political parties, party systems, and the domestic politics of European integration. Opposing Europe? is a groundbreaking, 'state of the art' book that provides a definitive review of a key issue in European politics. It is also one of the few attempts to integrate the fields of EU studies with both West European and East European studies in order to draw lessons about the way in which the EU interacts with domestic politics in both member and non-member states. Examining the way that parties position themselves and compete on the European issue provides powerful lessons for the trajectory of the European integration project more generally, and on the prospects for the emergence of a European political system and polity},

@article{Tsebelis.1995,
 abstract = {[The article compares different political systems with respect to one property: their capacity to produce policy change. I define the basic concept of the article, the 'veto player': veto players are individual or collective actors whose agreement (by majority rule for collective actors) is required for a change of the status quo. Two categories of veto players are identified in the article: institutional and partisan. Institutional veto players (president, chambers) exist in presidential systems while partisan veto players (parties) exist at least in parliamentary systems. Westminster systems, dominant party systems and single-party minority governments have only one veto player, while coalitions in parliamentary systems, presidential or federal systems have multiple veto players. The potential for policy change decreases with the number of veto players, the lack of congruence (dissimilarity of policy positions among veto players) and the cohesion (similarity of policy positions among the constituent units of each veto player) of these players. The veto player framework produces results different from existing theories in comparative politics, but congruent with existing empirical studies. In addition, it permits comparisons across different political and party systems. Finally, the veto player framework enables predictions about government instability (in parliamentary systems) or regime instability (in presidential systems); these predictions are supported by available evidence.]},

@misc{Tushnet.2020,
 abstract = {Around the world governments characterized by observers as populist have taken power. Many of their actions have been incompatible with tenets of modern liberalism.  This has generated commentary suggesting that populism is itself incompatible with constitutionalism.This Essay challenges that commentary. We agree that some variants of populism are incompatible with modern liberal constitutionalism but argue that the tension between populism as such and constitutionalism as such, though real, is significantly narrower than much commentary suggests. We begin in Section II by offering ``barebones'' definitions of populism and constitutionalism so that we can tease out precisely what the tension between them is. Section III turns to case studies of challenges to judicial independence, of the use of referendums, and of innovative methods of determining the public's views. As with our discussion of defining populism and constitutionalism, here we attempt to identify whether (or the degree to which) the case studies demonstrate a tension between populism and constitutionalism. Our conclusion is that sometimes we can see such a tension and sometimes we cannot, and that the analysis of specific populisms and their policies in relation to constitutionalism must be highly sensitive to context.Section IV applies the argument to two developments in the United Kingdom: the Brexit referendum and the attempt by Boris Johnson to prorogue Parliament and the ensuing decision by the UK Supreme Court finding the prorogation unlawful. Here our conclusion once again that analysis of populism's relation to constitutionalism must be sensitive to context: The referendum was flawed but not in ways that cast a bad light on populism as such, and the prorogation, while perhaps unlawful, was not clearly anti-constitutional.Overall we argue against generalized claims about populism as such and constitutionalism as such. There are many populisms and at least a few constitutionalisms, and scholars and observers should direct their attention to the questions posed by specific actions taken by individual populist governments. Sometimes populist governments will act in anti-constitutional ways, and sometimes they will not. We believe that this conclusion is appropriately deflationary.},

@article{Ura.2010,
 abstract = {Scholars often assert that public support for judicial authority induces Congress to grant resources and discretion to the Supreme Court. However, the theory of competing public agency embraced by the Constitution suggests that public support for courts cannot, by itself, explain congressional support for judicial authority. Instead, the logic of the separation of powers system indicates that legislative support for the institutional capacity of courts will be a function of public confidence in the legislature as well as evaluations of the judiciary. We test this theory, finding that public confidence in both Congress and the Court significantly affect congressional support for the Supreme Court, controlling for the ideological distance between the Court and Congress as well as the Court's workload. The results offer a more refined and complex view of the role of public sentiment in balancing institutional power in American politics.},

This leads us to question the still popular assumption that these individuals are politically uninformed. Simultaneously, given the current political and media climate and debates about ?fake news?, this article asks to what extent misinformation, i.e. the possession of erroneous political information, stimulates populist party support. Survey data from nine European democracies are used to assess to what extent populist party supporters differ from abstainers and non-populist party supporters in terms of their political information and misinformation. It is found that holding correct political information relates positively to the likelihood of turning out, whether it is to support populist or non-populist parties. It is further found that political misinformation relates positively to support for right-wing populist parties. The findings provide a first empirical and comparative contribution to recent debates that seek to connect misinformation and political behaviour.},

 abstract = {During the past three decades, anti-immigration parties have emerged all over Western Europe. Some of them have been treated like any other party by their mainstream opponents and a few have even become members of governing coalitions (e.g., the Austrian FP{\"O}). Other such parties have been politically excluded: established parties have refrained from any cooperation with them and in some cases even refused to enter into a political debate with their politicians. This article investigates how the strategy of ostracising anti-immigration parties affects the internal dynamics within these parties. In particular, we assess whether these parties radicalise as a result of this strategy, and, conversely whether it has a moderating effect when these parties are approached more pragmatically. Our analyses, regarding ten parties at several moments in time, show that anti-immigration parties that were not ostracised became more moderate, whereas those that were treated as outcasts continued to be extremist.},

@article{Verba.1996,
 abstract = {[Citizen participation is the main way in which the public communicates its needs and preferences to the government and induces the government to be responsive. Since participation depends on resources and resources are unequally distributed, the resulting communication is a biased representation of the public. Thus, the democratic ideal of equal consideration is violated. Sample surveys provide the closest approximation to an unbiased representation of the public because participation in a survey requires no resources and because surveys eliminate the selection bias inherent in the fact that participants in politics are self-selected. The contrast between the participatory process and the sample survey is used to highlight the nature of the bias in the former. Surveys, however, are not seen as a practical way of providing more equal representation.]},

We examine Supreme Court news in elite newspapers, television news broadcasts, and online news sources during the October 2008 and 2010 terms. The results of our quantitative analyses indicate that all three types of news outlets are more likely to provide content about Supreme Court decisions with substantive importance but vary in their responses to costs and qualities appealing to the lay audience. We conclude by discussing the similarities and differences among news outlets with regard to their selection of Supreme Court information as news content.},

@article{Voeten.2020b,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT How does increasing the number of women on the bench affect the outcome of judicial proceedings? This article evaluates this question in the European Court of Human Rights using a new dataset that incorporates both the gender of judges and applicants to the Court. This allows us to examine whether female judges differentially evaluate human rights claimed filed by women. There are four main findings. First, women disproportionally file property rights claims, an issue that has received very little attention in the literature on gender and courts. Second, the analysis confirms findings from the US context that female judges are more favorably disposed towards discrimination cases filed by women. Third, other than on discrimination issues, female judges are not more likely than male judges to support rights claims filed by women. Fourth, female judges are overall more likely to find violations, regardless of the gender of applicants. This is especially true on cases involving physical integrity rights violations, such as torture. This is consistent with earlier findings that women are on average less willing to compromise on physical integrity rights for security reasons.},

We complement this analysis of historical biases in diachronic word embeddings with a novel measure of bias on the basis of term co-occurrences and graph-based label propagation. The results of our bias measurements align with commonly perceived historical trends of antisemitic and anti-communist biases in German politics in different time periods, thus indicating the viability of analyzing historical bias trends using semantic spaces induced from historical corpora.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACTMany social scientists recognize that quantitative text analysis is a useful research methodology, but its application is still concentrated in documents written in European languages, especially English, and few sub-fields of political science, such as comparative politics and legislative studies. This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.},

@book{Wessels.2008,
 abstract = {Wer die politischen Realit{\"a}ten Europas verstehen will, muss einen betr{\"a}chtlichen Teil seiner Aufmerksamkeit dem System der Europ{\"a}ischen Union (EU) und dessen institutioneller Architektur widmen. Dabei gilt es insbesondere, die recht unterschiedlichen Formen zu verstehen, nach denen die Institutionen der EU f{\"u}r die Mitgliedstaaten und die Unionsb{\"u}rger verbindliche Entscheidungen vorbereiten, verabschieden und kontrollieren. Mit wachsender politischer Relevanz wird das EU-System leider auch immer unverst{\"a}ndlicher.  Deshalb dient dieses Buch einer umfassenden und gr{\"u}ndlichen Einf{\"u}hrung, wobei es besonderen Wert auf die Vermittlung von notwendigen Grundkenntnissen zur Geschichte, zu einzelnen Institutionen und zu zentralen Verfahren der EU legt. Zur Vertiefung werden wesentliche Aspekte in gr{\"o}{\ss}ere Zusammenh{\"a}nge unterschiedlicher Ans{\"a}tze der {\textquotedbl}Europa-{\textquotedbl} bzw. {\textquotedbl}Integrationswissenschaft{\textquotedbl} gestellt. Mit Hilfe mehrerer Darstellungsformen bietet das Buch f{\"u}r Interessierte und Experten aus Lehre, Forschung, Politik und Medien ein differenziertes Angebot zum Verst{\"a}ndnis dieses komplexen und zunehmend relevanten Teils unseres politischen Lebens zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts.},

@misc{Widmer.15.02.2022,
 abstract = {This paper analyzes the influence of partisan content from national cable TV news on local reporting in U.S. newspapers. We provide a new machine-learning-based measure of cable news slant, trained on a corpus of 40K transcribed TV episodes from Fox News Channel (FNC), CNN, and MSNBC (2005-2008). Applying the method to a corpus of 24M local newspaper articles, we find that in response to an exogenous increase in local viewership of FNC relative to CNN/MSNBC, local newspaper articles become more similar to FNC transcripts (and vice versa). Consistent with newspapers responding to changes in reader preferences, we see a shift in the framing of local news coverage rather than just direct borrowing of cable news content. Further, cable news slant polarizes local news content: right-leaning newspapers tend to adopt right-wing FNC language, while left-leaning newspapers tend to become more left-wing. Media slant is contagious.},

@article{Zimring.2006,
 abstract = {[It is unlikely that hostile attitudes about criminals or beliefs that punishments for crime were too lenient were the major causes of the explosive increase in punishments in the United States after 1970. Public hostility toward criminals has been a consistent theme in this country for a long time, but it did not cause big increases in imprisonment before 1970 in the United States or large expansions of incarceration elsewhere. In this article, the authors argue that growth in the salience of crime as a citizen concern and increasing public distrust of government competence and legitimacy were two of a number of changes that transformed ever-present hostile attitudes into a dynamic force in American politics. Negative attitudes toward offenders are a necessary condition for anticrime crusades, but they are always present. It was the addition of fear and distrust into the law and politics of punishment setting that produced the perfect storm of punitive expansion.]},
