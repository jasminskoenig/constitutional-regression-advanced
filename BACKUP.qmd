he authors leave out states in which the effect of populism on democratic quality cannot be classified so clearly (for example, Greece or Bolivia[@Mudde.2013b; @Blokker.2019d] ). 

To discuss the relationship between populism and constitutional regression, we first introduce the concept of democratic regression. Based on this discussion, we show that law has a special significance in the process of democratic regression. We discuss different approaches to the meaning of law in democratic regression and describe our understanding of constitutional regression. In the next step, we use the definition of populism as a thin ideology[@Mudde.2004] to explain the relationship between populism and constitutionalism.

2.1 Definition of Constitutional Regression

Democratic regression refers to a decline in democratic quality. What exactly constitutes a decline in democratic quality is disputed [@Gerschewski.2021]. Scholars agree that democratic regression happens more slowly in recent years and is mostly carried out by (at least nominally) democratically elected governments. In the past, democratic systems were often undermined by coups [@Bermeo.2016]. Today, incumbents and officeholders who want to secure their power undermine democratic rules and values, and with it the democratic system [@Bermeo.2016; @Huq.2018; @Levitsky.2018; @Svolik.2015].

Going further into the details of democratic regression, we find more discussions around the term. While some authors argue that democratic regression always takes place within a democracy and thus can never describe the collapse of a democracy [@TOMINI.2018], other authors also understand a hybrid system between democracy and autocracy as a possible outcome [@Bermeo.2016 ; @Huq.2018]. In our analysis, we apply the latter understanding and also include periods in which states were already considered electoral (but not closed) autocracies in order to gain the most comprehensive understanding of the influence of populism on constitutional regression.

The core of democratic regression is usually described as executive aggrandizement: the strengthening of executive power while constraining veto players and opposition [@Bermeo.2016 ; @Ginsburg.2018; @Scheppele.2018, p. 549; @Satrio.2018, pp. 276-277; @Karolewski.2021, p. 313; @Waldner.2018, p. 95; @Khaitan.2019, p. 344; @Diamond.2021]. In the course of democratic regression, checks and balances within the political system are weakened, leaving the government subject to fewer and fewer checks and balances.

Which other mechanisms are part of democratic regression, however, varies widely by definition. Some authors speak of democratic regression only when free elections are also restricted, for example by redrawing constituencies, manipulating the media exposure of candidates, or making it more difficult for certain groups to participate in elections [@Huq.2018, p. 83; @Waldner.2018, p. 95]. Likewise, the restriction of opposition, freedom of the press, freedom of movement, freedom of association, and science and media are discussed as elements of democratic regression [@Huq.2018, p. 83; @TOMINI.2018, p. 693; @Levitsky.2018; @Diamond.2021 ]. Less frequently mentioned are a decline in citizen participation for example due to declining voter turnout or a dismantling of direct democratic elements, as well as regressions in the inclusion of disadvantaged population groups [@Waldner.2018, p. 95; @TOMINI.2018, p. 693.].

The debate on democratic regression often focuses on the weakening of liberal democratic institutions and (in-)formal norms [@Bermeo.2016; @Levitsky.2018; @Diamond.2021]. This is increasingly criticized. Authors have recently started to emphasize the importance of civil society in the concept of democratic regression [@Karolewski.2021; @Wolkenstein.2022; @Schafer.2021]. They argue that decreasing inclusion, or fewer participation mechanisms, as well as citizens' attitudes towards democracy should be considered as an aspect of democratic regression as well. Sometimes a decrease in the quality of liberal democratic institutions might even be considered as an increase in other aspects of democratic quality. A democracy can also fail to serve its purpose and lose quality if all institutions are still intact but citizens no longer want to be involved in the political process and slip into a passive behavior. Schäfer and Zürn additionally point out that representation is not always responsive and that the interests of different social groups are not always equally well represented [@Schafer.2021, pp. 96-101]. A growing lack of responsiveness and an increasing inequality in the representation of different social groups can also mean a decline in democratic quality. We account for this in our analysis by using multiple indices to measure democratic quality.

The Importance of Legal Changes in Democratic Regression

Liberal democratic regression is closely linked to legal change. In many liberal democracies, the norms and institutions described are enshrined in constitutions, or at least in ordinary law. This gives the mechanism of (constitutional) legal change a special significance within the process of democratic regression [@Huq.2018; @Scheppele.2018].

Particularly when officeholders and incumbents aim to ensure that their state continues to appear democratic, law gains weight in the process of democratic regression [@Landau.2013]. In the case of an unconstitutional act such as a coup, it matters little whether the law is adapted. Today, however, democratic regression often takes place under the cover of democratic government. Changes in the law can be an important part of this cover to legitimize the autocratic goals of democratically elected officeholders and incumbents." [@Scheppele.2018]

The undermining of liberal democratic institutions through (constitutional) legal change has been debated in recent years under terms such as constitutional retrogression [@Huq.2018], autocratic legalism [@Scheppele.2018], and abusive constitutionalism [@Landau.2013]. The relevance of law in the course of democratic regression can be seen in the multitude of terms that have emerged in recent years to describe this process alone. Almost every article dealing with democratic regression also addresses changes in law [@Scheppele.2018; @Gerschewski.2021; @Karolewski.2021; @Huq.2018; @Khaitan.2019; @Bermeo.2016].

The term constitutional retrogression already points to the relevance of constitutions in the context of democratic regression [@Huq.2018]. At its core, the authors focus on the restriction of elections, freedom of expression and assembly, and the rule of law. By rule of law, the authors mean "stability, predictability, and integrity of law and legal institutions."[@Huq.2018, pp. 87-88] While this definition is directed at various rights, their design, and the legal system, the authors explicitly point out that constitutional amendments are only one mechanism of constitutional retrogression [@Huq.2018, p. 124.]. Huq and Ginsburg also include in their concept legal amendments that violate the character of the constitution but do not require a constitutional amendment. Scheppele pursues a similar concept with the term autocratic legalism [@Scheppele.2018]. She, too, is concerned with amendments to constitutions or simple law. However, her work is primarily devoted to restrictions on the separation of powers as well as the centralization of executive power.

The concept of abusive constitutionalism is limited to constitutional amendments or renewals aimed at undermining democracy [@Landau.2018]. The goal here is said to be -- along with the elements of democratic regression discussed earlier -- the centralization of power in the executive branch, the restriction of veto players and elections, and the curtailment of minority and fundamental rights.

The importance of the distinction between constitutional law and ordinary law can be seen in our case study analyses of Hungary and Poland: Whereas in Hungary the constitution was amended to limit the independence of the judiciary, in Poland this was possible even without this step -- and thus with a smaller parliamentary majority. We argue, however, that categorizing both types of regression together does not do justice to the situation, even if they are similar: A restructuring of liberal democratic institutions through constitutional amendments is a more permanent step. To reverse constitutional regression, many states require larger or long-term majorities in order to amend the constitution. We discuss this problem in more detail in the empirical section, using Hungary as a case study.

Therefore, our understanding of constitutional regression builds on the notion of abusive constitutionalism. In line with Landau, we include only constitutional amendments in our analysis. We thus understand constitutional regression as one or more constitutional amendments that lead to a decline in democratic quality, but include multiple democratic dimensions. Our understanding of democratic and constitutional regression thus goes beyond the institution-based definitions of Scheppele, Landau, Huq, and Ginsburg. As we show in the discussion of populism in the coming section, this distinction is important, to assess the effect of populism on constitutional regression and to address the criticism of authors who see the notion of democratic regression as too institution-based [@Karolewski.2021; @Wolkenstein.2022].

2.2 Populism and Constitutional Regression

The debate on democratic regression repeatedly links the development to the growing number of cases in which populist parties are involved in democratic governments [@Schafer.2021; @Ginsburg.2018; @Diamond.2021]. As noted above, looking at the tension between populism and constitutionalism raises the question of whether constitutional amendments by populist parties lead to a deterioration in the quality of democracy. We first introduce the concept of populism in this section before discussing its relationship to constitutionalism and democratic quality in the next step.
